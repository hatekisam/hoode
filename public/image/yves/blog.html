The results may fall into the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Risk</strong>: Addresses flagged as high risk indicate a strong association with suspicious activity and potential involvement in fraudulent schemes. Caution is advised when dealing with such addresses.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspicious</strong>: Addresses classified as suspicious may have some indicators of potential risks. Although not necessarily indicative of illicit activities, it is advisable to exercise caution and further scrutiny when engaging with these addresses.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Risk</strong>: Addresses labeled as medium risk suggest a moderate level of potential risk. While not as alarming as high-risk addresses, it is still prudent to proceed with caution.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Risk</strong>: Addresses categorized as low risk indicate minimal or negligible potential risk, providing a higher level of confidence in their legitimacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/status_check_8184fd9a67.png\" alt=\"status check.png\" ></p>\n<p>But that&#39;s not all!

There are many different blockchain networks on the market;  some of them are faster, while others have longer confirmation time. To understand how the process works, we’ll take Bitcoin as an example.</p>\n<p><strong>How does a Bitcoin transaction get confirmed?</strong></p>\n<p>When a Bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the network, it gets propagated to network participants responsible for verifying the transaction history and securing the network. These individuals are known as Bitcoin nodes. After successful verification, the transaction is sent to the mempool (or memory pool). The mempool is where all unconfirmed transactions wait to get picked up by miners and included in a new block. When your transaction gets selected and becomes a part of the next block, it receives its first confirmation and is considered confirmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is there a waiting time for confirmations?</strong> </p>\n<p>Bitcoin has a network difficulty setting, which dictates that each new block will be mined 10 minutes after the last one on average. Even if you paid the highest possible fee, you must still wait for the following block to be mined. When selecting which transactions to include in the next block, miners will always select those paying the biggest fees. Why? Because the fees are a part of their mining reward rate.</p>\n<p>Once an issued transaction is successfully added to a created block, it automatically receives a confirmation. The number of confirmations a transaction goes through is dependent on a number of factors. By a general rule of thumb,  the larger the amount of Bitcoin you transact, the greater the number of necessary transactions. </p>\n<p>While 1 or 2 confirmations are usually enough for payments less than $1000, as much as  6 to 10 confirmations are required for transactions above $10,000 and above sixty for payments more than a million dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>How to select an appropriate fee?</strong>  </p>\n<p>If you are in a hurry and want a quick confirmation, you should pay a higher network fee. If your transaction is not urgent, you can select a lower one. Each Bitcoin transaction has a size denominated in vMBs (virtual Megabytes). Miners prefer transactions with a higher fee rate. A fee rate is a number of satoshis (smallest bitcoin unit) the sender is ready to pay per vByte.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin wallets, such as <a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">NOW Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://guarda.com/\">Guarda Wallet</a> or <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\">Atomic Wallet</a>, have a fee estimator in the software. That can be used when selecting the appropriate fees. </p>\n<p>To get a better overview of the current state of the mempool and a more precise fee estimator, we suggest using <a href=\"https://mempool.space/\">Mempool.Space</a>. Use the high priority suggestion when you need a quick confirmation, or stick with the low or medium priority estimations when your transactions aren’t time-sensitive. </p>\n<p><strong>How much time does a confirmation take?</strong></p>\n<p>Different blockchains have different transaction confirmation speed. Among popular cryptos, Bitcoin is one of the slowest networks. Check out the graph that reflects it’s confirmation time/fee relation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pisk1K44sQBw8n2R7xTi7WxK6JcW-XBL-qQ5BKJzw3m7kmAxhw1WYkVOsvXMY4YiabW707-jgu5u2Fq7NhQs8t3ZzyD5VTohx8MynixsdTIczn0s46NDPx6QQ5WwxQ\" alt=\"crypto transaction confirmation time\" ></p>\n<p><strong>Can ChangeNOW somehow lower the confirmation time for my transaction?</strong></p>\n<p>Not really. But remember that the higher the fee, the faster the transaction is confirmed.</p>\n<p><strong>My transactions are often stuck. What can I do about it?</strong></p>\n<p>You are probably using a poorly managed wallet. Try <a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">NOW Wallet</a> instead. </p>\n<p>We designed this lightweight mobile wallet so you can enjoy secure crypto storage in an intuitive interface. The wallet is available for Android and iOS devices and allows you to access your crypto 24/7.  In NOW Wallet, you can buy or store crypto together with 550+ other digital assets. We constantly increase the number of available coins and improve the wallet in general by adding new features such as staking, NFT storage, and many others.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I know my transaction is confirmed?</strong></p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/explorer\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://live.blockcypher.com\">this website</a> and check your transaction status using transaction ID. </p>\n<p><strong>I was exchanging on ChangeNOW and my transaction got stuck. What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://support.changenow.io/hc/en-us/requests/new\">address your problem</a> to our 24/7 tech support team. </p>\n<p><strong>Tips to Lower the Network Fees</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>  Don’t send <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> during high network congestion (unless it’s urgent) when the fees spike, causing difficulties in getting a quick confirmation. Congestions usually occur when the value of bitcoin rises or drops significantly. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>  Consolidate your small inputs (the different bitcoin transactions you received throughout times) into a single input during cycles when the transaction fees are low. The more inputs and outputs (the addresses you send to) your transaction has, the more you’ll have to pay in fees. Spending coins from 1 input requires much lower costs than spending from 5 different inputs, no matter the number of coins that are being transferred.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":7,"name":"Tech","description":"Long reads on the technical side of crypto and blockchain projects – both for tech-savvy and crypto novices.\n","slug":"tech","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Tech - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Long reads on the technical side of crypto and blockchain projects – both for tech-savvy and crypto novices.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"../images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Ex editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"../content-api-sub/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"../content-api-sub/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"../content-api-sub/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"../content-api-sub/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"../content-api-sub/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T17:20:50.693Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["tech"],"publishedAt":"2021-06-01T18:59:04.000Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:46.943Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-27T14:20:09.730Z"},{"id":513,"title":"Is ChangeNOW Legit?

The abundance of scams and overnight platforms offering exchange services for digital assets makes it difficult for users to distinguish legitimate services from frauds. One of the platforms that has received a lot of user attention is the ChangeNOW service. Just as most platforms on the market, it is sometimes supposed to be a scam. Yes, sudden lags in transaction times, exchange rate fluctuations and other technical difficulties often make users suspicious of crypto scam. Still, it is both important and relieving to remember such difficulties are always temporary and do not mean that the exchange in question does not provide trustworthy financial services. The given material will provide insights into the operations of ChangeNOW and try to answer the question of whether ChangeNOW is legit and the issue migrating on numerous forum boards as “is ChangeNOW trustworthy?”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-changenow\">What Is ChangeNOW?</h2>\n<p>ChangeNOW is a <a href=\"https://changenow.io/exchange\">crypto exchange</a> platform that has been operating since 2017, allowing users to swap various cryptocurrencies almost instantly. The current <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies\">list of crypto assets</a> presented on the platform includes almost 400 digital currencies. The exchange allows users to transfer their assets directly to both hardware and hot wallets with a number of valuable features and functions that make it popular among users. The service is largely available worldwide and provides support in 28 languages, making it widely available for the majority of the crypto community.

At its core, ChangeNOW is a non-custodial exchange service that has no limits on operations conducted on its basis. The commissions fees provided on the platform are considered to be the mean average on the market, or standard for the industry, and stand at a reasonable level of 0.5%. However, the website contains a disclaimer, which makes it clear that exchange rate fluctuations can affect the rate. In addition to crypto asset payment channels, ChangeNOW offers users the chance to <a href=\"https://changenow.io/buy\">buy and sell cryptocurrencies</a> using their VISA or MasterCard credit or debit bank cards, making it quite convenient. As for rates, ChangeNOW works as an aggregator of cryptocurrency prices from leading trading platforms to form profitable exchange rates for its users based on the best price.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that ChangeNOW is more than just a crypto exchange service. At this point, the platform’s large ecosystem includes many products such as <a href=\"https://changenow.io/mobile-exchange\">mobile exchange app</a>, <a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">NOW Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://nowtracker.app\">NOWTracker</a>, <a href=\"https://nowpayments.io\">NOWPayments</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/crypto-loan\">NOWLoans</a>, <a href=\"https://nownodes.io\">NOWNodes</a>, Telegram Bot, etc. </p>\n<h2 id=\"is-changenow-legit\">Is ChangeNOW Legit?</h2>\n<p>The question of whether ChangeNOW is reliable has to be approached from the aspects of the information the service provides on its operations and the feedback it receives from users. When it comes to legitimacy, a legal entity established in a country with favorable crypto regulation is a good indicator of reliability, as it will allow any disaffected users to file official complaints in case of gross breach of conduct. The ChangeNOW official website provides all the necessary details on the legal address and registration information of the entity. The <a href=\"https://changenow.io/about\">information</a> provided states that the exchange is registered as CHN Group Limited. The company’s office is in the Seychelles at House of Francis, Room 303, Ile Du Port, Mahe, with a postal address at Newtonlaan 115, Utrecht, 3584 BH, Netherlands. Based on checks of the provided information, it is clear that ChangeNOW is a legitimate exchange and can be included in the list of reliable exchanges for operations. The fact that the company has been up and running since 2017 without significant disruptions is a good indicator of reliability. In addition, the official website provides information on downloads of the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/mobile-exchange\">ChangeNOW mobile app</a> and <a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">NOW Crypto Wallet</a>, which is in the tens of thousands. The number of visitors stated is also impressive, which would not have been so had the platform been unreliable. The platform is also known to be safe and has good security features, providing user funds with the benefit of never storing their funds on the platform. Such an approach automatically negates the risk of fraud or hacking attacks. In addition, internal security checks are triggered with mandatory <a href=\"https://changenow.io/faq/kyc\">KYC and AML</a> procedures in case users exhibit suspicious activity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"additional-key-features\">Additional Key Features</h2>\n<p>Legit exchanges boast popularity, because they provide their users with high quality services. Scam services of this type are usually made with minimal effort to quickly attract trusting users and steal their funds. The question posed by users “is ChangeNOW trustworthy” can be easily answered by a review of the main features and functions that the service provides. Among the features that attract users to ChangeNOW are its user-friendly interface, instant transfer times, reasonable exchange rates, lack of registration requirements, and high levels of customer service. And though the service does require KYC and AML in case of large transfers, that is more of a benefit that underscores its legitimacy.

Get ready for a deep dive into the fascinating world of Monero and privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/06_30_Monero_5ba643c7dd.png\" alt=\"06.30 Monero.png\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"moneros-privacy-features-and-use-cases\">Monero&#39;s Privacy Features and Use Cases</h2>\n<p>Monero has gained a significant following due to its focus on privacy and anonymity. Unlike Bitcoin, where all transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques to obfuscate transaction details. This ensures that users can enjoy unrestricted financial freedom without worrying about their transactions being traced or linked to their identities.</p>\n<p>The privacy features of <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/monero?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=xmr+surges+to+new+heights\">Monero</a> make it highly attractive for various use cases. One of the primary use cases is in the realm of online transactions. With Monero, users can <strong>make purchases online without the fear of their transaction history being visible</strong> to prying eyes. This makes it an ideal cryptocurrency for those who value their privacy and want to maintain anonymity while conducting online transactions.</p>\n<p>Another use case for Monero is in <strong>decentralized finance (DeFi)</strong>. As DeFi gains popularity, privacy becomes a crucial aspect for users who want to engage in decentralized lending and borrowing, yield farming, and other financial activities. Monero&#39;s privacy features provide an added layer of security and confidentiality, making it an excellent choice for DeFi enthusiasts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moneros-price-surge-and-the-rise-of-privacy-coins\">Monero&#39;s Price Surge and the Rise of Privacy Coins</h2>\n<p>In recent years, there has been a surge in interest from governments worldwide in exploring the concept of <strong>CBDCs</strong>. While CBDCs offer many benefits, concerns about privacy have emerged. The <strong>Bank of England&#39;s CBDC</strong> project head, Tom Mutton, assured the public that the central bank would not share personal data with any government organizations. However, the inherent lack of privacy in CBDCs has led to increased interest in privacy-enhanced coins like <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/monero?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=xmr+surges+to+new+heights\">Monero</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/zcash?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=xmr+surges+to+new+heights\">ZCash</a>, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dash?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=xmr+surges+to+new+heights\">Dash</a>.</p>\n<p>Privacy coins like Monero have long been known for their emphasis on anonymity and confidentiality. Unlike CBDCs, where data can be accessed by governments through court orders, private cryptocurrencies offer users complete control over their financial information. With Monero, for example, transactions are viewable on the blockchain, but the sender and receiver remain anonymous, ensuring complete privacy.</p>\n<p><div style=\"margin-top:30px;display:flex;justify-content:center\">\n              <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/monero?from=usd&to=xmr&fiatMode=true&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=xmr+surges+to+new+heights\"  style=\"background:#ff6600;box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(43,43,54,.1);border-radius: 8px;color: #fff;font-size: 15px;padding: 10px 30px;border: none;\">Buy XMR</a>\n            </div></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-moneros-price-is-going-up\">Why Monero&#39;s Price is Going Up</h2>\n<p>According to recent analysis, Monero (XMR) has a bullish outlook on the daily time frame, with several reasons to support this claim.

One of the key advantages of the Casper Network is its robust security measures, which ensure the <strong>integrity and confidentiality of data on the blockchain</strong>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"decentralized-and-immutable-ledger\">Decentralized and Immutable Ledger</h3>\n<p>The Casper Network operates on a <strong>decentralized ledger</strong>, which means that it is not controlled by a single entity. This decentralized nature makes it extremely difficult for malicious actors to tamper with the data on the blockchain. Each transaction is verified and recorded by multiple validators, ensuring the accuracy and immutability of the ledger.</p>\n<h3 id=\"proof-of-stake-pos-consensus-protocol\">Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus Protocol</h3>\n<p>The Casper Network utilizes a <strong>Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong> consensus protocol, specifically the Casper Correct by Construction (CBC) protocol. PoS consensus mechanisms are known for their superior security and energy efficiency compared to traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols. In the Casper CBC model, validators with a stake in the network must sign off on new blocks before they are added to the blockchain. This ensures that <strong>the network is secure</strong> and that <strong>transactions are propagated throughout the entire network</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upgradeable-smart-contracts\">Upgradeable Smart Contracts</h3>\n<p>Casper Network offers <strong>upgradeable smart contracts</strong>, a feature that sets it apart from many other blockchain platforms. This allows for the quick patching of vulnerabilities and the adaptation of smart contracts to changing business needs. By enabling the upgradability of smart contracts, Casper Network helps businesses <strong>build resilient and scalable blockchain-based products</strong> and services that can evolve with their customers&#39; requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"developer-friendly-features\">Developer-Friendly Features</h3>\n<p>Casper Network is designed to be developer-friendly, making it easier for businesses to find talented developers who can contribute to their blockchain initiatives. Unlike many other blockchain projects that require developers to use specific programming languages, Casper supports popular languages like <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>WebAssembly (WASM)</strong>. This opens up opportunities for mainstream developers to participate in blockchain development and brings in a broader pool of talent to enhance the security and efficiency of the network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lower-gas-costs\">Lower Gas Costs</h3>\n<p><strong>Gas fees</strong>, or transaction fees, are an essential aspect of blockchain networks. The Casper Network has implemented measures to optimize gas fees, ensuring <strong>price stability during changes</strong> in order size or periods of high transaction volume. Additionally, the CasperLabs team is working towards a predictive gas futures market, allowing enterprises <strong>to reserve gas ahead of time at predetermined prices</strong>, providing better planning and cost management for businesses.</p>\n<p><div style=\"margin-top:30px;display:flex;justify-content:center\">\n              <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/casper?from=usd&to=cspr&fiatMode=true&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=cspr+and+changenow\"  style=\"background:#fe2b2d;box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(43,43,54,.1);border-radius: 8px;color: #fff;font-size: 15px;padding: 10px 30px;border: none;\">Buy CSPR</a>\n            </div></p>\n<h2 id=\"cspr-token-overview-and-why-it-is-secure\">CSPR Token Overview and Why It Is Secure</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/casper?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=cspr+and+changenow\">CSPR</a> token is the native cryptocurrency of the Casper Network. It plays a vital role in securing the network and incentivizing validators to participate in the consensus process. Here&#39;s an overview of the CSPR token and why it is secure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Staking and Consensus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Validators in the Casper Network are required to stake CSPR tokens as collateral to participate in the consensus process. This stake acts as a security measure, as validators have a financial interest in maintaining the integrity of the network. Validators who behave maliciously or violate network rules risk losing their staked tokens, incentivizing them to act honestly and securely.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Inflationary Issuance Schedule</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The CSPR token follows a slightly inflationary issuance schedule, ensuring a steady and sustainable supply of tokens.

It is an essential step in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and preventing fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities. KYC typically involves providing personal identification documents and additional information to establish a customer&#39;s identity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/06_28_CN_x_Guardarian_new_feature_fea6364bc3.png\" alt=\"06.28 CN x Guardarian new feature.png\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"simplifying-the-kyc-process\">Simplifying the KYC Process</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, when users engage with different platforms or services, they are required to complete the KYC process separately for each one. This can be time-consuming and repetitive, especially for frequent cryptocurrency traders. However, with the new integration between <a href=\"https://changenow.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=kyc+guardarian\">ChangeNOW</a> and <a href=\"https://guardarian.com/\">Guardarian</a>, <strong>users can skip the KYC process</strong> when buying or selling crypto via Guardarian if they meet certain conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conditions-and-benefits\">Conditions and Benefits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To qualify for the shared KYC procedure, users <strong>must have a verified profile on ChangeNOW</strong> and have <strong>successfully completed the KYC procedure</strong>. This exciting feature is currently available for users from the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the introduction of SumSub&#39;s innovative solution, known as <strong>shareToken</strong>, the secure sharing of KYC data between platforms becomes possible. Once users complete the KYC process on one platform, they can seamlessly switch between integrated platforms without needing to repeat the KYC procedure. This integration streamlines the customer onboarding process, reduces manual effort, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"important-considerations\">Important Considerations</h2>\n<p>While the shared KYC procedure allows users to skip the Guardarian KYC process, it&#39;s essential to note that <strong>Guardarian still subjects users to internal risk checks</strong>. These checks are in place to enhance security and mitigate potential risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. In certain cases, additional verifications by SumSub, such as card verifications and live face matches, may be triggered. Users are encouraged to review Guardarian&#39;s <a href=\"https://guardarian.com/aml-policy\">AML/CTF (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing) policy</a> for more detailed information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-started-and-enjoy-seamless-transactions\">Get Started and Enjoy Seamless Transactions</h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re a crypto enthusiast from the EU or the UK, now is the perfect time to take advantage of ChangeNOW and Guardarian&#39;s shared KYC procedure for verified profiles.

Users can buy, sell, and trade TipsyVerse Assets, creating a vibrant and dynamic marketplace within the ecosystem.

By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, TipsyCoin creates a secure, transparent, and dynamic environment for users to explore and engage with. And by catering for a mainstream audience, blockchain connection to the TipsyVerse Games is purely optional; a growing player base can depend on GIN - which is the ecosystem&#39;s unified in-game currency. Being the only governance token of the ecosystem, TIPSY will continue to be valuable since it is limited in supply, and can be staked to earn GIN.</p>\n<p>So, if you&#39;re looking to buy TIPSY tokens and be part of this groundbreaking ecosystem, head over to <a href=\"https://changenow.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=tipsycoin+overview\">ChangeNOW</a>, the best platform for buying and exchanging crypto, including <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tipsycoin?from=usd&amp;to=tipsy&amp;fiatMode=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=tipsycoin+overview\">TIPSY</a> tokens.

Since then, BTC has evolved from a niche concept to a global phenomenon. Its decentralized nature and potential as a store of value have attracted millions of investors worldwide.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Bitcoin has experienced significant highs and lows. It has weathered market crashes and regulatory challenges, demonstrating resilience and bouncing back stronger than ever. Despite the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=buying+bitcoin+in+2023\">BTC</a> has consistently recovered from major downturns and reached <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/bitcoins-bull-run-price-breaks-dollar30000-barrier-once-more\">new all-time highs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reasons-to-consider-buying-bitcoin\">Reasons to Consider Buying Bitcoin</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-limited-supply-and-halving-events\">1. Limited Supply and Halving Events</h3>\n<p>One of the fundamental factors contributing to Bitcoin&#39;s value is its <strong>limited supply</strong>. Unlike traditional currencies, which can be endlessly printed by central banks, there will only ever be <strong>21 million BTC</strong> in existence. This scarcity drives demand, as investors seek to acquire a portion of the finite supply.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin undergoes a halving event approximately <strong>every four years</strong>. During these events, the number of new Bitcoins generated through mining is cut in half. This reduction in supply has historically led to an increase in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?from=usd&amp;to=btc&amp;fiatMode=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=buying+bitcoin+in+2023\">BTC</a>&#39;s price, as the scarcity intensifies. Get ready, because the countdown to the next Bitcoin halving is on, and it&#39;s happening in <strong>less than 300 days</strong>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-growing-institutional-adoption\">2. Growing Institutional Adoption</h3>\n<p>In recent years, institutional investors have increasingly recognized the potential of Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Renowned companies such as <strong>MicroStrategy</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong> have allocated a portion of their treasury reserves to <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?from=usd&amp;to=btc&amp;fiatMode=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=buying+bitcoin+in+2023\">BTC</a>, signaling confidence in its long-term value. Additionally, global investment banks like <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan</strong> have begun offering Bitcoin-related products and services to their clients.</p>\n<p>This institutional adoption brings increased liquidity to the market and instills confidence in potential investors. It also suggests that Bitcoin is becoming a more mainstream investment option, with the potential for further growth as more institutions enter the space.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-store-of-value-and-hedge-against-inflation\">3. Store of Value and Hedge Against Inflation</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=buying+bitcoin+in+2023\">Bitcoin</a> has often been referred to as &quot;digital gold&quot; due to its similarities to the precious metal. Like gold, BTC can serve as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. In times of economic uncertainty or currency devaluation, investors seek assets that can retain their value or even appreciate.</p>\n<p>With its decentralized nature and limited supply, Bitcoin offers an alternative to traditional fiat currencies that can be subject to inflationary pressures. As more individuals and institutions view BTC as a safe haven asset, its value may continue to rise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-technological-advancements-and-adoption\">4. Technological Advancements and Adoption</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin&#39;s underlying technology, blockchain, has the potential to revolutionize various industries beyond finance. As more companies and governments explore blockchain applications, the demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may increase.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Bitcoin&#39;s adoption as a payment method has grown steadily over the years. Major companies such as <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>, and <strong>Overstock.com</strong> accept <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=buying+bitcoin+in+2023\">BTC</a> as a form of payment, further solidifying its position as a legitimate and practical currency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-market-cycle-analysis\">5. Market Cycle Analysis</h3>\n<p>Analyzing Bitcoin&#39;s historical market cycles can provide insights into potential future price movements. BTC has exhibited <strong>cyclical patterns</strong>, characterized by periods of significant growth followed by market corrections. These cycles often coincide with <strong>halving events</strong> and <strong>periods of increased media attention</strong>.</p>\n<p>Based on past market cycles, Bitcoin has shown a consistent pattern of recovery and reaching new all-time highs. While past performance is not indicative of future results, understanding these patterns can help investors make informed decisions.</p>\n<p><div style=\"margin-top:30px;display:flex;justify-content:center\">\n              <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?from=usd&to=btc&fiatMode=true&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=buying+bitcoin+in+2023\"  style=\"background:#f2a900;box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(43,43,54,.1);border-radius: 8px;color: #fff;font-size: 15px;padding: 10px 30px;border: none;\">Buy BTC</a>\n            </div></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-current-state-of-the-market\">The Current State of the Market</h2>\n<p>As of the time of writing, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=buying+bitcoin+in+2023\">Bitcoin</a> is trading at approximately $30,549. The year 2022 has been challenging for BTC, with a significant decrease in its market value. However, recent developments suggest that the market may be entering a period of recovery.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin&#39;s volatility, which was once a concern for many investors, has decreased significantly. This decrease in volatility indicates a <strong>more stable market</strong>, potentially attracting long-term investors. Moreover, BTC&#39;s correlation with gold has increased, indicating that it is being viewed as a safe haven asset. Conversely, its correlation with tech stocks has decreased, suggesting that it is no longer solely associated with high-growth investments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-choose-changenow-for-buying-and-exchanging-btc\">Why Choose ChangeNOW for Buying and Exchanging BTC</h2>\n<p>When considering buying or <strong>exchanging BTC</strong>, it&#39;s crucial to choose a reliable and user-friendly platform. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=buying+bitcoin+in+2023\">ChangeNOW</a> is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform that offers a seamless and secure experience for investors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-wide-range-of-cryptocurrencies\">1.

In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the different ways crypto wallets can be hacked and explore <strong>strategies to prevent such attacks</strong>. Whether you&#39;re a seasoned crypto user or just starting out, understanding the potential risks and implementing proper security measures is crucial for safeguarding your digital assets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/06_21_Can_Crypto_Wallets_Truly_be_Hacked_01_2b381d1048.png\" alt=\"06.21 Can Crypto Wallets Truly be Hacked-01.png\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-crypto-wallets\">Understanding Crypto Wallets</h2>\n<p>Before we dive into the various hacking techniques, let&#39;s first clarify what a crypto wallet is. A <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/?download=&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=can+crypto+wallets+be+hacked\">crypto wallet</a> is a <strong>software application that enables users to securely store, send, and receive digital currencies</strong>. It interacts with the blockchain network, allowing users to manage their private keys, which are essential for authorizing transactions. It&#39;s important to note that a wallet is not the same as an address. Wallets manage multiple addresses, each associated with a unique public key, while addresses serve as the destination for sending and receiving funds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hacking-techniques-targeting-crypto-wallets\">Hacking Techniques Targeting Crypto Wallets</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-phishing-attacks\">1. Phishing Attacks</h3>\n<p>One of the most common hacking techniques is <strong>phishing</strong>, where attackers trick users into revealing their private keys or sensitive information. Phishing attacks typically involve fake websites or emails that mimic legitimate crypto platforms, luring users to enter their credentials. These malicious actors exploit human vulnerabilities and use social engineering tactics to deceive unsuspecting individuals. By falling victim to a phishing attack, users unknowingly provide hackers with access to their wallets.</p>\n<p>To protect yourself against phishing attacks, it&#39;s crucial to <strong>verify the authenticity of websites and emails</strong> before sharing any personal or financial information. Always double-check the website&#39;s URL and ensure it uses secure encryption (HTTPS). Be cautious of unsolicited emails and avoid clicking on suspicious links. Additionally, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security and makes it more difficult for hackers to gain unauthorized access to your wallet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-malware-attacks\">2. Malware Attacks</h3>\n<p><strong>Malware attacks</strong> target users&#39; devices, infecting them with malicious software designed to steal sensitive information, including private keys. These attacks can occur through various means, such as downloading infected files, visiting compromised websites, or clicking on malicious advertisements. Once the malware gains access to a user&#39;s device, it can monitor keystrokes, capture screenshots, and even modify wallet addresses during transactions, redirecting funds to the attacker&#39;s address.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the risk of malware attacks, it&#39;s essential to <strong>keep your devices and software up to date with the latest security patches</strong>. Install reputable antivirus or anti-malware software to detect and remove any potential threats. Be cautious when downloading files or clicking on links, especially from untrusted sources. Regularly scan your devices for malware and avoid visiting suspicious websites.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-keyloggers\">3. Keyloggers</h3>\n<p>Keyloggers are a <strong>type of malware that records every keystroke made on an infected device</strong>, including passwords, private keys, and other sensitive information. Attackers use keyloggers to gather data covertly and gain unauthorized access to crypto wallets. These malware programs can be installed through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or compromised websites.</p>\n<p>To protect against keyloggers, <strong>use virtual keyboards or password managers</strong> that encrypt keystrokes and protect your sensitive information. Be vigilant about the websites you visit and avoid downloading files from untrusted sources. Regularly scan your devices for malware and consider using dedicated security tools to detect and remove keyloggers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-smartphone-hacks\">4. Smartphone Hacks</h3>\n<p>As mobile devices become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, they have also become targets for hackers. Smartphone hacks can occur through various methods, including phishing attacks, malware downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system. Once a hacker gains control of a user&#39;s smartphone, they can access crypto wallet apps and steal private keys or manipulate transactions.</p>\n<p>To protect your smartphone from hacking attempts, always install the latest software updates and security patches. <strong>Avoid downloading apps or files from untrusted sources</strong> and be cautious of suspicious links or emails. Consider using reputable security software specifically designed for mobile devices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-wallet-vulnerability-exploitation\">5. Wallet Vulnerability Exploitation</h3>\n<p>Despite the inherent security measures in crypto wallets, vulnerabilities can still exist. Hackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to wallets and steal funds. These vulnerabilities can arise from <strong>coding errors, software bugs, or design flaws in the wallet&#39;s infrastructure</strong>. It&#39;s crucial for wallet developers to regularly update and patch any identified vulnerabilities to maintain the highest level of security.</p>\n<p>As a user, it&#39;s essential to choose wallets from reputable and trusted developers who prioritize security. Research the wallet&#39;s track record, read reviews, and ensure it has a strong reputation within the crypto community. Opt for wallets that undergo regular security audits and have a dedicated team actively addressing and patching vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><div style=\"margin-top:30px;display:flex;justify-content:center\">\n              <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://walletnow.app/?download=&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=can+crypto+wallets+be+hacked\"  style=\"background:#00c26f;box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(43,43,54,.1);border-radius: 8px;color: #fff;font-size: 15px;padding: 10px 30px;border: none;\">Download NOW Wallet</a>\n            </div></p>\n<h2 id=\"preventing-wallet-hacks\">Preventing Wallet Hacks</h2>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve explored the various hacking techniques targeting crypto wallets, let&#39;s discuss strategies to prevent wallet hacks and safeguard your digital assets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose a Secure Wallet</strong>: Selecting the right wallet is key to protecting your crypto assets. Consider using a non-custodial wallet that gives you full control of your private keys. Non-custodial wallets, such as the NOW Wallet, prioritize security and allow you to store your private keys securely on your own device. Additionally, hardware wallets, like the popular Ledger and Trezor devices, offer an extra layer of security by keeping private keys offline.</li>\n<li><strong>Practice Good Security Hygiene</strong>: Maintaining good security hygiene is essential to prevent wallet hacks. Create strong, unique passwords for your wallets and regularly update them. Avoid reusing passwords across different platforms, as this increases the risk of compromise. Consider using a reputable password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay Vigilant Against Phishing Attacks</strong>: Phishing attacks are prevalent in the crypto space, so it&#39;s crucial to stay vigilant. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or links, especially those requesting sensitive information. Always verify the authenticity of websites and ensure they use secure encryption. If in doubt, contact the official support channels of the wallet or platform to confirm the legitimacy of any requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Your Devices Secure</strong>: Securing your devices is fundamental to protecting your crypto wallet. Regularly update your operating system and software with the latest security patches. Install reputable antivirus or anti-malware software and scan your devices regularly for potential threats. Only download apps or files from trusted sources, and be cautious of suspicious links or advertisements.</li>\n<li><strong>Backup Your Wallet</strong>: Always create a backup of your <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/?download=&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=can+crypto+wallets+be+hacked\">crypto wallet</a> and store it securely in multiple locations. This ensures that even if your device is lost, stolen, or compromised, you can still recover your funds using the backup. Use encrypted storage devices or cloud services to store your backups securely.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay Informed and Educated</strong>: The crypto landscape is continuously evolving, and new hacking techniques may emerge. Stay informed about the latest security practices and developments in the crypto space. Follow reputable sources, participate in community forums, and engage with experienced crypto users to enhance your knowledge and understanding of wallet security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>While crypto wallets offer convenience and security for managing digital assets, they are not immune to hacking attempts. Understanding the various hacking techniques and implementing robust security measures is crucial to safeguarding your crypto wallet and funds. By choosing reputable wallets, enabling two-factor authentication, practicing good security hygiene, and staying vigilant against phishing attacks, you can significantly reduce the risk of wallet hacks.

By offering developers a scalable, high-throughput, and fast finality environment, Boba Network has become an attractive platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/06_13_NOW_Solutions_and_Boba_Network_Create_a_Fortress_of_Crypto_Security_868defeae1.png\" alt=\"06.13 NOW Solutions and Boba Network Create a Fortress of Crypto Security.png\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"security-measures-on-the-boba-network\">Security Measures on the Boba Network</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://boba.network/\">Boba Network</a> employs various security measures to ensure the integrity and reliability of its operations. </p>\n<p>One fundamental aspect is its utilization of an <strong>Optimistic rollup mechanism</strong>, which enables efficient data transfer between Layer 2 (L2) and Ethereum. With Optimistic rollups, no computation takes place on-chain. Instead, the network assumes the validity of all state changes and posts off-chain transactions to Ethereum&#39;s layer 1 as calldata. To facilitate this process, the network relies on a sequencer, responsible for ordering and bundling transactions into batches on L2 before submitting them as a single transaction to Ethereum. Currently, the sequencer is operated by Boba Network, but future governance mechanisms will govern its operation.</p>\n<p>To address the potential risks associated with fraudulent transactions, the Boba Network has implemented a challenge/dispute period that lasts approximately one week after the posting of transactions to L1. During this time, third parties have the opportunity to publish fraud proofs to validate the transactions across L1 and L2. If any invalid transactions are identified, <strong>the network reverts them along with all affected transactions</strong>. However, it is important to note that fraud proofs are not yet enabled as the network is still under development.</p>\n<p>In addition to its security measures, the Boba Network has introduced the <strong>Hybrid Compute</strong> feature, offering enhanced functionalities and interaction with non-distributed computer systems (Web2 systems). This capability serves as a <strong>bridge between the network&#39;s sequencer and external sources&#39; APIs</strong>, enabling Boba Network smart contracts to communicate and interact seamlessly with existing Web2 systems. </p>\n<p>With its commitment to security, fast withdrawals, and unique features like Hybrid Compute, the Boba Network is shaping a <strong>robust and efficient ecosystem</strong> that offers users a reliable and optimized blockchain experience. By implementing innovative security measures and continuously enhancing its capabilities, the Boba Network aims to foster trust and provide a secure foundation for its users to interact and transact seamlessly within the network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"boba-token-supported-by-now-solutions\">BOBA Token Supported by NOW Solutions</h2>\n<p>As a strong advocate for secure and reliable projects, NOW Solutions has extended its support to the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/boba-network-erc20?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=boba+security\">BOBA token</a>, the native cryptocurrency of the Boba Network.

On Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin soared, <strong>breaking the $30,000 barrier</strong> for the first time in months. The cryptocurrency reached its zenith at an impressive $30,749.45, marking a significant milestone in its journey.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/06_22_Bitcoin_s_Bull_Run_Price_Breaks_30_000_Barrier_Once_More_93c9b3db48.png\" alt=\"06.22 Bitcoin&#39;s Bull Run_ Price Breaks $30,000 Barrier Once More.png\" ></p>\n<p>Just a week ago, BTC experienced a significant downturn, dropping below the $25,000 threshold. This decline was accompanied by regulatory lawsuits targeting major industry players like Binance and Coinbase, as well as the Federal Reserve&#39;s cautious approach to interest rate hikes. Despite these challenges, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoins+bull+run\">Bitcoin</a> has managed to defy the odds and stage a remarkable comeback.</p>\n<h2 id=\"factors-driving-the-bullish-momentum\">Factors Driving the Bullish Momentum</h2>\n<p>The current bullish surge in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoins+bull+run\">BTC</a> can be attributed to several key factors that have contributed to the renewed interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-institutional-adoption-a-game-changer-for-bitcoin\">1. Institutional Adoption: A Game-Changer for Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>One of the primary catalysts behind the ongoing rally in BTC is the increasing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Market giants like <strong>BlackRock</strong> and <strong>Fidelity</strong> Investments have emerged as prominent proponents, filing for spot Bitcoin ETFs and paving the way for broader adoption.</p>\n<p>BlackRock, the renowned global money manager, made headlines recently by seeking registration for a spot-market Bitcoin ETF. While the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is yet to approve any applications for such ETFs, this move by BlackRock signifies a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-positive-developments-in-the-crypto-ecosystem\">2. Positive Developments in the Crypto Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>In addition to institutional adoption, positive developments within the crypto ecosystem have contributed to the recent surge in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?from=usd&amp;to=btc&amp;fiatMode=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoins+bull+run\">BTC price</a>. The launch of EDX Markets, a new digital-asset exchange, has generated a burst of positivity in the market. Industry players such as <strong>Citadel Securities</strong>, <strong>Fidelity Digital Assets</strong>, and <strong>Charles Schwab Corp</strong> have rallied behind this innovative exchange, providing support and expertise to ensure its success.</p>\n<p>These developments, coupled with growing acceptance by mainstream businesses and a favorable regulatory landscape, have created a conducive environment for Bitcoin&#39;s upward momentum.</p>\n<p><div style=\"margin-top:30px;display:flex;justify-content:center\">\n              <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?from=usd&to=btc&fiatMode=true&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=bitcoins+bull+run\"  style=\"background:#00c26f;box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(43,43,54,.1);border-radius: 8px;color: #fff;font-size: 15px;padding: 10px 30px;border: none;\">Buy BTC</a>\n            </div></p>\n<h3 id=\"3-whale-transactions-and-market-sentiment\">3. Whale Transactions and Market Sentiment</h3>\n<p>Market data reveals that whale transactions in the Bitcoin network have hit a three-month high, signaling increased activity and confidence among large BTC holders. <strong>Santiment</strong>, a leading market intelligence platform, reported that whales moved 259 transactions <strong>worth at least $1 million each</strong> within two hours of the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?from=usd&amp;to=btc&amp;fiatMode=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoins+bull+run\">BTC price</a> crossing $30,600. This surge in whale activity further strengthens the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and its potential for further growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assessing-the-bull-run-is-it-a-turning-point-or-a-temporary-bounce\">Assessing the Bull Run: Is it a Turning Point or a Temporary Bounce?</h2>\n<p>While the recent surge in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?from=usd&amp;to=btc&amp;fiatMode=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoins+bull+run\">BTC price</a> offers a glimmer of hope, it is essential to approach the situation with caution and assess the broader market dynamics. Investors find themselves grappling with a crucial question: Does the current rally signify a definitive turnaround for Bitcoin&#39;s fortunes, or is it merely a fleeting phenomenon known as a &quot;dead cat bounce&quot;?</p>\n<p>A dead cat bounce refers to a temporary price rebound within a broader negative trend, ultimately leading to a resumption of downward movement. Given the complexities of the present market environment, including geopolitical dynamics, economic indicators, crypto regulations, and the Federal Reserve&#39;s stance on interest rates, accurately predicting short-term price movements in the digital asset realm is challenging even for seasoned industry insiders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-road-ahead-navigating-uncertain-waters\">The Road Ahead: Navigating Uncertain Waters</h2>\n<p>As Bitcoin continues to chart new territory and the crypto market evolves, it is crucial to consider the intertwined factors that will ultimately shape the trajectory of <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin?from=usd&amp;to=btc&amp;fiatMode=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoins+bull+run\">BTC</a> and other cryptocurrencies. While the recent price surge is undoubtedly a positive development, it is essential to maintain a long-term perspective and carefully monitor market dynamics.</p>\n<p>As an investor, it is crucial to stay informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market, conduct thorough research, and seek expert advice when making investment decisions. While BTC&#39;s recent rally is encouraging, it is vital to exercise caution and invest wisely based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.</p>\n<p>With Bitcoin&#39;s resurgence, now may be an opportune time to explore the potential of this digital asset.

It was designed to offer faster transaction confirmations and a more efficient mining process than Bitcoin. With a maximum supply of 84 million coins, Litecoin has become one of the most popular and widely accepted cryptocurrencies in the market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-significance-of-litecoins-halving\">The Significance of Litecoin&#39;s Halving</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin?from=usd&amp;to=ltc&amp;fiatMode=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=litecoins+halving\">Litecoin</a>&#39;s halving is a highly anticipated event that occurs approximately <strong>every four years</strong>. In this process, the block reward for miners validating transactions on the Litecoin blockchain is cut in half. This mechanism is designed <strong>to manage inflation, introduce scarcity, and potentially drive up the value of Litecoin</strong> over time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-impact-on-litecoins-supply-and-market-dynamics\">The Impact on Litecoin&#39;s Supply and Market Dynamics</h3>\n<p>Litecoin&#39;s halving plays a crucial role in <strong>regulating the supply and demand dynamics</strong> of the cryptocurrency. With each halving, the reward for miners is reduced, resulting in a decreased supply of new coins entering the market. As the mining process becomes more challenging and expensive, the scarcity of Litecoin is expected to increase, <strong>potentially leading to a surge in demand</strong> and a subsequent <strong>rise in its price</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-historical-context-of-litecoins-halving\">The Historical Context of Litecoin&#39;s Halving</h2>\n<p>To fully appreciate the significance of <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=litecoins+halving\">Litecoin</a>&#39;s upcoming halving, it&#39;s essential to examine the historical context of previous halving events.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-genesis-of-litecoin-and-its-first-halving\">The Genesis of Litecoin and Its First Halving</h3>\n<p>Litecoin&#39;s journey began on <strong>October 7, 2011</strong>, with the mining of its genesis block, which had a block reward of 50<a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=litecoins+halving\"> LTC</a>. Four years later, on <strong>August 25, 2015</strong>, Litecoin experienced its first halving at a block height of 840,000. This event reduced the block reward to 25 LTC, marking a significant milestone in Litecoin&#39;s history.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-second-halving-and-its-impact\">The Second Halving and Its Impact</h3>\n<p>The second halving occurred on <strong>August 5, 2019</strong>, at a block height of 1,680,000. This event further reduced the block reward to 12.5 <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=litecoins+halving\">LTC</a>. While the second halving did not have an immediate and significant impact on Litecoin&#39;s price, it set the stage for future developments and heightened anticipation for the upcoming halving.</p>\n<h3 id=\"litecoins-third-halving-the-catalyst-for-price-surge\">Litecoin&#39;s Third Halving: The Catalyst for Price Surge?</h3>\n<p>As we approach <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=litecoins+halving\">Litecoin</a>&#39;s third halving on <strong>August 2, 2023</strong>, speculations abound regarding its potential impact on the price of Litecoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>\n<p>The two previous halving events in Litecoin&#39;s history have been associated with price rallies, leading some analysts to predict a potential surge in the price of Litecoin. Based on the historical price trends of previous halvings and the principles of supply and demand, there is a possibility of a substantial upside, with some estimates projecting a <strong>potential increase of up to 200%</strong>.</p>\n<p>While the prospect of a halving rally is captivating, it&#39;s important to approach market timing with caution. Timing the market accurately can be challenging, and entering too early or too late may result in varying returns. Additionally, past halving events have seen mixed results, with some instances failing to produce the anticipated price surge. It&#39;s crucial to consider these factors and exercise prudent judgment when making investment decisions.</p>\n<p><div style=\"margin-top:30px;display:flex;justify-content:center\">\n              <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin?from=usd&to=ltc&fiatMode=true&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=litecoins+halving\"  style=\"background:#00aeff;box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(43,43,54,.1);border-radius: 8px;color: #fff;font-size: 15px;padding: 10px 30px;border: none;\">Buy LTC</a>\n            </div></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-long-term-catalysts-for-litecoin\">The Long-Term Catalysts for Litecoin</h2>\n<p>While the halving event generates significant interest in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=litecoins+halving\">Litecoin</a>, it&#39;s crucial to assess the long-term catalysts that can drive sustained growth and adoption.</p>\n<p>Litecoin has made notable strides in improving its underlying technology, including implementing the <strong>Litecoin Improvement Proposal (LIP)</strong> process to enhance the protocol.

However, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies also introduces unique challenges, particularly when it comes to security. The crypto industry has witnessed numerous instances of <strong>exchange hacks</strong> and <strong>fraudulent activities</strong>, emphasizing the need for robust security measures.</p>\n<p>When engaging in crypto transactions, it is crucial to <strong>choose a platform that prioritizes security and protects your assets</strong>. Custodial and non-custodial solutions are two distinct approaches to managing crypto transactions, each with its own set of advantages and limitations. Understanding the differences between these solutions is essential for making informed decisions and safeguarding your digital assets.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://changenow.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=custodial+vs+non+custodial\">ChangeNOW</a>, we recognize the importance of security in the crypto space. As a trusted platform for secure crypto exchanges, we prioritize the safety and privacy of our users. </p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-custodial-solutions\">Understanding Custodial Solutions</h2>\n<p><strong>Custodial solutions</strong>, also known as centralized platforms, are commonly used by individuals new to the crypto space due to their ease of use and accessibility. These platforms act as intermediaries, <strong>holding users&#39; funds on their behalf</strong>. When you create an account on a custodial platform, you entrust them with the responsibility of securing your crypto assets.</p>\n<p>Custodial platforms typically provide features such as integrated crypto exchanges, enabling seamless transactions within a single interface. Additionally, custodial platforms often offer customer support services, providing assistance in case of any issues or concerns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploring-non-custodial-solutions\">Exploring Non-Custodial Solutions</h2>\n<p><strong>Non-custodial solutions</strong>, also known as self-custody or decentralized platforms, offer a different approach to managing crypto transactions. These solutions prioritize user control and ownership of assets, allowing individuals to have full control over their private keys, which act as the gateway to accessing and transferring their crypto assets.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular types of non-custodial solutions is <strong>hardware wallets</strong>. These physical devices store private keys offline, providing an additional layer of security by keeping the keys away from potential online threats. </p>\n<p><strong>Software wallets</strong> are another type of non-custodial solution that users can install on their computers or mobile devices. These wallets are often provided by reputable companies and offer a user-friendly interface for managing crypto assets. Examples of software wallets include <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a>, Trust Wallet, and MetaMask. While software wallets provide convenience, it is crucial to take precautions such as regularly updating the wallet software and ensuring the security of your device to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.</p>\n<p><div style=\"margin-top:30px;display:flex;justify-content:center\">\n              <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://changenow.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=custodial+vs+non+custodial\"  style=\"background:#00c26f;box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(43,43,54,.1);border-radius: 8px;color: #fff;font-size: 15px;padding: 10px 30px;border: none;\">Exchange Crypto</a>\n            </div></p>\n<h2 id=\"security-comparison-custodial-vs-non-custodial\">Security Comparison: Custodial vs Non-Custodial</h2>\n<p>When it comes to security, custodial and non-custodial solutions offer different approaches and levels of protection. Understanding the security features and risks associated with each solution is essential for making an informed decision about how to manage your crypto transactions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Custodial Solutions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Custodial solutions provide a user-friendly experience, allowing individuals to easily access and manage their crypto assets. These platforms often implement various security measures, such as <strong>encryption protocols</strong> and <strong>cold storage</strong>, to protect user funds. However, custodial solutions require a degree of trust in the platform&#39;s security practices. If a custodial platform experiences a security breach, users&#39; funds may be at risk.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Non-Custodial Solutions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-custodial solutions prioritize user control and ownership of assets. By maintaining sole ownership of your private keys, <strong>you have full control over your crypto assets</strong> and <strong>reduce the reliance on third-party custodians</strong>. This increased control and ownership enhance security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your funds. However, non-custodial solutions also come with the responsibility of <strong>securely managing your private keys</strong>, as losing access to them can result in permanent loss of your assets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"changenows-approach\">ChangeNOW&#39;s Approach</h3>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://changenow.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=custodial+vs+non+custodial\">ChangeNOW</a>, we have implemented a <strong>non-custodial approach</strong> to secure crypto exchanges.

This proprietary technology enables developers to construct dApps that boast transaction speeds of less than two seconds, a feature that sets Fantom apart from the crowd​.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/06_19_Exploring_the_Fantom_Frontier_Speed_Security_and_Exceptional_d_Apps_19f22e8725.png\" alt=\"06.19 Exploring the Fantom Frontier- Speed, Security, and Exceptional dApps.png\" ></p>\n<p>But it&#39;s not just speed that has catapulted Fantom to its current heights. The Fantom network has also struck a delicate balance between scalability, security, and decentralization, the three pillars of any robust blockchain platform. Its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, designed to be leaderless, ensures that no single participant has the power to validate block transactions. This democratic approach not only improves the network&#39;s security but also optimizes its efficiency, making it an attractive platform for developers and users alike​.</p>\n<p>The combination of Fantom&#39;s speed, security, and decentralized structure has resulted in a vibrant ecosystem of dApps. From decentralized exchanges to Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplaces, Fantom&#39;s dApps cater to a broad range of financial activities, all while offering the quick transaction speeds and low fees that are characteristic of the Fantom network.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s dive deeper into some of the top dApps that have found their home on the Fantom network. These applications not only exhibit the potential and versatility of Fantom&#39;s blockchain platform but also provide practical, user-friendly solutions for crypto enthusiasts to engage with DeFi. Whether you&#39;re looking to trade tokens, purchase NFTs, or participate in yield farming, Fantom&#39;s dApp ecosystem has something for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-fantom-dapps\">Top Fantom dApps</h2>\n<p>Here are some top decentralized applications (dApps) running on the Fantom network:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>SpookySwap</strong>: SpookySwap is an all-in-one decentralized exchange for leveraging diversified funds across ecosystems, operating on the Fantom Opera network. It offers services like token swapping, liquidity supplying, and staking at farms to earn BOOs. They are working towards a platform governed through community voting and are known for their speed, security, and scalable transactions​.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>WigoSwap</strong>: WigoSwap is a Super dApp aiming to revolutionize the Fantom DeFi ecosystem by establishing itself as the go-to platform for dApps on Fantom. It has introduced DeTasker, a decentralized work platform, and has a unique Gamified Burning Mechanism (GBM) to incentivize user engagement. They plan to expand their offerings to include a suite of decentralized applications catering to various user needs​​.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Equalizer</strong>: a decentralized exchange aimed at becoming the main trading mechanism for the Fantom network. It utilizes the Solidly perpetual model with adjustments to fee structures and emissions to sustain emission token prices. The model rewards liquidity providers with valuable tokens, akin to the Curve model. This approach aims to balance rewards for token holders and incentives for liquidity providers while maintaining sufficient liquidity for low-slippage trades.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>SpiritSwap</strong>: SpiritSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Fantom Opera Chain, with its design initially based on the Uniswap constant-product automated market maker (AMM). With the introduction of the V2 model, SpiritSwap has significantly diverged from the original Uniswap design, offering a unique experience to the Fantom community. It is similar to SpookySwap, also offering yield farming opportunities but with lower fees​​.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>PaintSwap</strong>: An NFT marketplace where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs at affordable transaction costs​.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Beethoven X</strong>: A balancer-style automated market maker (AMM) available on Fantom​.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Navigating the expansive landscape of Fantom dApps can seem like a daunting task, especially when considering the essential aspect of security. Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we approach data, finance, and online interactions, but it also introduces unique security challenges. While Fantom&#39;s architecture and consensus model contribute to its robust security framework, users must still exercise caution when interacting with dApps, as they would with any online platform.</p>\n<p>Now, let&#39;s shift our focus to one of the key gateways to these dApps - <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a>.
