This coin has a very interesting origin. Back in 2014, a Bitcointalk forum contributor named “Thankful_for_Today” forked the code for Bytecoin and called it BitMonero. Thankful_for_Today then exited the development stage and after a few days, a group of developers that included Johnny Mnemonic took over the forked project and renamed it Monero. The crypto had strong privacy and this led to the strong growth of the community, and by 2016, it had the highest transaction volumes of any crypto. However, the big break came in January 2017, when it was adopted by Gregory Maxwell (Bitcoin core developer)’s algorithm called confidential transactions for hiding amounts that were being transacted. This initiated a significant gain, and during the 2017 crypto bull market, it peaked at an all-time high of $495.84.

The key difference is that Bitcoin (BTC) is the older chain, while the latter is a fork. While this coin was created in July 2017 through a hard fork of Bitcoin, the concept of it dates back to as far back as late 2015. At the time, there were growing concerns about Bitcoin’s scalability, and a section of the community wanted to accommodate more transactions by expanding the block size. One of the key proponents of a block size increase was Roger Ver (the main figure behind it). When consensus failed, Ver and like-minded investors forked Bitcoin and created Bitcoin Cash, a similar chain, but with a bigger block size. Since its launch, this coin’s price has moved in tandem with the rest of the crypto market and hit an all-time high of $4,355.62 in December 2017. It has since dropped and ranks, 5th, with a market cap of $5.493 billion.

It is also one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in existence, because the idea is a little older than Bitcoin itself. In 2005, Jed McCaleb came up with the idea of a financial services system that would act as a secure mode of payment for online transactions. He then approached Arthur Britto and David Schwartz, who built it with the help of Ryan Fugger, who as far back as 2005, had built such a system and named it Opencoin. It is the Opencoin system that formed the basis of Ripplelabs, and the cryptocurrency that debuted in the crypto markets as Ripple in 2012. Like most cryptocurrencies, XRP became most visible to the masses during the 2017 crypto rally. At the time, the crypto rallied to a high of over $3.5 on December 29th, 2017, and with a market cap of $73 billion.

Related to speed is the feature of scalability. A major advantage that centralized systems such as Visa have over cryptos is that of scalability. Most blockchains can handle very few transactions per second, making them impractical for large scale use in the finance industry. XPR does not have this problem and can consistently handle more than 1500 transactions per second. In fact, as of July 15th, 2019, it could handle over 65,000 transactions per second, making it competitive as a global payment system. The other key feature is decentralization. In the past, there were concerns that XRP is a centralized coin where RippleLabs controls all the validator nodes. This notion has since been dispelled as the network is run by more than 150 independent validators spread across the world. It is also for this reason that back in 2018, there was a rebranding from Ripple (XRP) to XRP (XRP). The goal was to help investors understand the difference between the company and the coin.
