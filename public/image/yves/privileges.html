At the moment of the trade, we’ll choose the best exchange rate on the market at any given moment and offer it to you.","Q3_TITLE":"Why trust us?","Q3_TEXT":"Created by a team of experienced blockchain developers, ChangeNOW is a fully secure service with a twist — we’re completely registration-free. This allows our clients to avoid identification or financial theft. We offer the best rates on the market, as we use reliable cryptocurrency trading platforms.","Q5_TITLE":"How fast will my transaction be processed?","Q5_TEXT":"The processing speed ranges from about two to twenty minutes, depending on how long it takes for a block to happen in the network. Most orders process in just a few minutes. If the transaction is large (more than 1 BTC or equivalent), processing it may take a little longer, depending on the size of your transaction and the capacity of the block. We boast the highest exchange speeds on the market thanks to our revolutionary trading algorithms.","Q6_TITLE":"Where do I store my crypto funds?","Q6_TEXT":"If you want to own cryptocurrency, you need to store it somewhere. Different cryptocurrency wallets are tailored specifically for different operations with transactions. There are official wallets, web purses, and other applications. For each crypto coin, you need to have a separate wallet.","Q7_TITLE":"What is cryptocurrency wallet address?","Q7_TEXT":"Cryptocurrency wallet address is a unique combination of numbers and letters ranging from 26 to 35 characters in length. It usually looks something like this: 17bkZPLB4Wn6F347PLZBR34ijhzQDUFZ4ZC.","Q8_TITLE":"How do I get my cryptocurrency wallet address?","Q8_TEXT_1":"When you decide which crypto coin you would like to acquire, find a reliable wallet. Each cryptocurrency has an official one. When you create a wallet, you automatically get an address and a private key. Keep your private key to yourself and don’t show it to anyone, even if they ask.","Q8_TEXT_2":"For security reasons, we will never ask you for your private keys and nobody should.","Q9_TITLE":"What is a recipient wallet address?","Q9_TEXT":"If you want to buy a cryptocurrency, you need to have it sent to a specific crypto wallet. Each coin has its own one. The recipient address is your wallet, to which your crypto is transferred after the exchange.","Q10_TITLE":"What is a transaction hash?","Q10_TEXT":"Transaction hash (also referred to as \"TX\") is the unique identification code that registers every transaction in the blockchain. This unique code allows you to verify its status and validity in the blockchain.","Q11_TITLE":"How can I cancel a transaction?","Q11_TEXT":"Blockchain operations are irreversible. If the funds are sent, the transaction cannot be canceled by anyone. Therefore, thoroughly check all the payment details before sending funds to anyone, including us or anyone else.","Q12_TITLE":"Why is the final amount of funds different from the initial amount?","Q12_TEXT":"It takes some time to process transactions. Due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency, speed is crucial, however, the final exchange rate can differ both in the positive or negative direction. What we guarantee is the best rate at the very moment of an exchange operation.","Q13_TITLE":"How long does it take for a transaction to be finished?","Q13_TEXT_1":"Transactions on ChangeNOW usually take from 5 to 30 minutes. If your transaction takes more time, it may be due to various issues:","Q13_TEXT_2":"DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, such problems happen from time to time, but we are always happy to help you and solve any issues;","Q13_TEXT_3":"Cryptocurrency updates. We may update the client and disable some coins. As soon as we turn them back on, you will get your funds right away;","Q13_TEXT_4":"The blockchain is overloaded. Too many transactions are waiting to be included into the blockchain, and yours may wait for its turn, too. Sometimes you might have to wait a little longer.","Q14_TITLE":"What is the minimal exchange amount on ChangeNOW?","Q14_TEXT":"There is no upper limit for cryptocurrency exchanges on ChangeNOW. However, there are lower limits: they are different for each coin and range from ~$1.7 to $20. We’re working on lowering the minimal exchange amounts for all the coins available on ChangeNOW. If the deposit you’ve sent us is less than the minimum exchange amount, we will not be able to finish the exchange and guarantee a refund.","Q37_TITLE":"What happens if I deposit an unsupported coin or token?","Q37_TEXT_1":"If you send in an asset that is not supported on ChangeNOW (full list of supported assets is available <a href=/>here</a>), unfortunately, we won’t be able to guarantee a refund. Please keep this in mind to make sure your funds are safe at all times.","Q15_TITLE":"What is a fixed rate cryptocurrency exchange?","Q15_TEXT_1":"A fixed rate crypto exchange is an exchange performed at the same rate which is displayed to the client at the beginning of an exchange, regardless of subsequent rate fluctuations.","Q15_TEXT_2":"In some cases, fixed-rate exchanges have lower rate but the opposite is also possible.","Q16_TITLE":"What's the difference between fixed rate flow and classic flow?","Q16_TEXT_1":"During the classic flow, each transaction may have its own unique exchange rate because of rate fluctuations, market conditions, and network fees. The rate might change at any moment; as a result, you might receive more or less than you thought you would.","Q16_TEXT_2":"Implementing fixed rate exchanges leads us to lay down a small reserve to guarantee your safety from exchange rate fluctuations. It's included into the rate you will see at the beginning of the exchange, no other fees included.","Q16_TEXT_3":"Because of the rate risks we take, the fixed rate may differ from the classic flow's rate. However, it gives our customers confidence in the amount they will receive.","Q17_TITLE":"When should I choose the fixed rate flow?","Q17_TEXT_1":"You may choose the fixed rate flow if you would like to be certain that the amount of crypto you'll receive will stay the same, no matter what. With fixed rate exchanges, our users enjoy the stability of their conversions and are safe from sudden rate drops.","Q17_TEXT_2":"In some cases, fixed-rate exchanges have lower rate but the opposite is also possible.","Q18_TITLE":"ChangeNOW performs certain cryptocurrency exchanges through third-party partner services. What does that mean?","Q18_TEXT_1":"It means exactly that — exchanges of certain trading pairs are carried through our partners. These exchanges aren't much different from regular ChangeNOW exchanges, however, there are a few things you might want to keep in mind:","Q18_TEXT_2":"In these cases we don't carry out any KYC checks on our side. However, they might be carried out by our partners;","Q18_TEXT_3":"Please be aware that other services that we are partnered with might have KYC policies that are different from ours;","Q18_TEXT_4":"However, us carrying out exchanges through third party services does not mean we forfeit our responsibility for the exchange. If you run into any issues during the exchange, just let our support team know and we'll help you out in the shortest time possible.","Q19_TITLE":"Do I need to register to use ChangeNOW?","Q19_TEXT_1":"In order to be able to use ChangeNOW, customers don't need to create any sort of accounts.","Q19_TEXT_2":"However, there are some exceptions.","Q19_TEXT_3":"ChangeNOW uses an automated risk management system to check all transactions. Each case will be considered individually. According to European AML directives, KYC regulations, and platform requirements, we will ask you to provide a scan of your ID document valid in your country, as well as some additional information on the funds’ origin.","Q20_TITLE":"KYC/AML explained","Q20_TEXT_1":"The crypto market is subject to a number of certain rules and regulations which make it mandatory for most crypto services to have the AML/KYC procedure implemented.","Q20_TEXT_2":"ChangeNOW strives to protect our clients from any type of scams and fraudulent activities in the crypto world and complies to all rules and regulations present at the moment, and one of the ways that enables us to do so is the KYC/AML procedure.","Q20_TEXT_3":"This procedure confirms the absolute legality of the transaction carried out by you before the regulatory institutions. Thus, you confirm that you are a law-abiding citizen and the state has no reason to address any claims towards you.","Q21_TITLE":"KYC/AML procedure","Q21_TEXT_1":"ChangeNOW’s AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by this system, the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then asked to confirm their identity.","Q21_TEXT_2":"There is a certain set of criteria that the system employs; however, they can’t be made public, otherwise there will be people who will try to abuse those criteria in order to cheat the algorithm.","Q21_TEXT_3":"This system has proven to be very useful against money launderers and scammers, since the KYC process allows us to tell an honest customer apart from a scammer very quickly and without any trouble.","Q21_TEXT_4":"Each KYC case is handled individually.

The most significant trouble was that the system became slow and inefficient. Therefore, the community decided in 2017 to fork the cryptocurrency to make it better. Out of all the Bitcoin forks, Bitcoin Cash became an identity in itself. The developers expanded the size of the existing blocks to 8MB in BCH, and the overall speed of a transaction surged. Many people found BCH a good alternative - and went for it.","TEXT_3":"Bitcoin Cash started its journey with a price of 700-500 USD per coin in July 2017.

The interesting fact here is that right after a year of this hit, December 2018 experienced the all-time low value of BCH, i.e., 75.03 USD.

But one of the currencies that also caught people’s attention during that phase was Stellar, or as you may know, XLM. Basically, Stellar is a peer-to-peer network that lets you transfer funds efficiently and safely. Plus, it has its own currency named Lumen. What made this platform different from others are the additional services. It charges you a minimal amount for a transaction, and it is as quick as a blink of an eye.","TEXT_3":"These two factors make it exciting enough to invest your money in XLM. But the list of the benefits doesn’t end here as several other interesting aspects might make you want to buy Stellar. First is that XLM is backed up with IBM.

In case you are worried about trust, the fact that such a tech giant as IBM made a deal with XLM is quite significant.","TEXT_4":"With so many advantages, Stellar stands among the most reliable currencies you can put your money in.

The benefit of using Lumens is that it is effortless to use. But these all pros of the platform brought the risk of spams. To avoid that, Stellar made a basic rule that you will have to maintain some Lumens in your wallet at all times. This is what makes sure that nothing goes wrong with them.","TEXT_3":"Let’s evaluate the Stellar price history. In the very first year, XLM encountered its all-time low as $0.001227. It took the currency almost four years to reach its all-time high value of $0.875563. If you go through the current stats, one Lumen token accounts for about $0.1.

The main task of Litecoin was to reduce the time required to confirm a new transaction, as well as to change the previous mining algorithm so that all members of the community could participate in the mining.","TEXT_8":"If you are interested in learning more about LTC you can check out our article <a href='../currencies/litecoin/'>What is Litecoin</a>!","NEWS_1":"What is the Best Wallet For Litecoin 2019?","NEWS_2":"Litecoin Trading Platform | Exchange Litecoin For Bitcoin Guide","NEWS_3":"Litecoin Price Prediction 2019","NEWS_4":"Cryptocurrency Security Tips","NEWS_8":"Cryptocurrency Trading Guides","NEWS_9":"LTC to XRP exchange","NEWS_10":"Exchange Litecoin to Bitcoin","NEWS_11":"Buy LTC with USD","NEWS_12":"What is Litecoin","NEWS_13":"What is the Best Wallet For Litecoin 2019?","NEWS_14":"Litecoin Trading Platform | Exchange Litecoin For Bitcoin Guide","NEWS_15":"Litecoin Price Prediction 2019","NEWS_16":"The future of blockchain and cryptocurrency","NEWS_17":"Interview with DigiByte Ambassador Josiah Spackman","NEWS_18":"Best Litecoin Coin Wallets"},"CURRENCIES_EXCHANGE_XMR":{"TEXT_1":"Monero Price Chart","TEXT_2":"Monero Background","TEXT_3":"It is one of the world's most recognized and respected privacy coins. This coin has a very interesting origin. Back in 2014, a Bitcointalk forum contributor named “Thankful_for_Today” forked the code for Bytecoin and called it BitMonero. Thankful_for_Today then exited the development stage and after a few days, a group of developers that included Johnny Mnemonic took over the forked project and renamed it Monero. The crypto had strong privacy and this led to the strong growth of the community, and by 2016, it had the highest transaction volumes of any crypto. However, the big break came in January 2017, when it was adopted by Gregory Maxwell (Bitcoin core developer)’s algorithm called confidential transactions for hiding amounts that were being transacted. This initiated a significant gain, and during the 2017 crypto bull market, it peaked at an all-time high of $495.84.

This is the way of ensuring that transactions cannot be traced back to the sender. Essentially, it's like putting a hundred fingerprints on a dollar note making it impossible to determine who it belongs to. Another interesting feature is the Public-View feature. This feature allows the sender to let other people see their public address if the need arises. This feature lowers the risk of the project getting in trouble with regulators due to its highly advanced privacy capabilities. \nIt also has an in-built scalability feature. This works by allowing the network to review all past transactions and automatically make changes to the block-size to factor in an increase in transaction volumes.","TEXT_6":"Why you need to convert Monero","TEXT_7":"Like all other cryptos, you need a way to <a href='../exchange-from-xmr/'>exchange XMR to other coins</a>, or cash.

It is also one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in existence, because the idea is a little older than Bitcoin itself. In 2005, Jed McCaleb came up with the idea of a financial services system that would act as a secure mode of payment for online transactions. He then approached Arthur Britto and David Schwartz, who built it with the help of Ryan Fugger, who as far back as 2005, had built such a system and named it Opencoin. It is the Opencoin system that formed the basis of Ripplelabs, and the cryptocurrency that debuted in the crypto markets as Ripple in 2012. Like most cryptocurrencies, XRP became most visible to the masses during the 2017 crypto rally. At the time, the crypto rallied to a high of over $3.5 on December 29th, 2017, and with a market cap of $73 billion. Like other cryptocurrencies, it has since corrected and currently has a market cap of about $13.67 billion.","TEXT_4":"Ripple Main features","TEXT_5":"The currencies ledger has several features that put it at the forefront of the crypto revolution. One of its key features is speed. This currency is one of the fastest ways to send money globally. One can send money using it to any part of the world in under 4 seconds. Related to speed is the feature of scalability. A major advantage that centralized systems such as Visa have over cryptos is that of scalability. Most blockchains can handle very few transactions per second, making them impractical for large scale use in the finance industry. XPR does not have this problem and can consistently handle more than 1500 transactions per second. In fact, as of July 15th, 2019, it could handle over 65,000 transactions per second, making it competitive as a global payment system. The other key feature is decentralization. In the past, there were concerns that XRP is a centralized coin where RippleLabs controls all the validator nodes. This notion has since been dispelled as the network is run by more than 150 independent validators spread across the world. It is also for this reason that back in 2018, there was a rebranding from Ripple (XRP) to XRP (XRP). The goal was to help investors understand the difference between the company and the coin. Lastly, it is eco-friendly. Unlike proof-of-work coins that require energy to produce, the currency’s ledger settles transactions without mining.","TEXT_6":"Why you need to convert XRP","TEXT_7":"Like all other cryptos, you need a way to <a href='/'>exchange Ripple to other coins</a>, or cash.

However, ChangeNOW simplifies the process so that users need to take no additional actions — they can just start staking.</p> <p>Here is an example:</p> <p>At first, a user has staked 100 NOW. After one week, the user received around 0.43 NOW. In a week ahead, the reward to be paid out will be calculated from 100.43 NOW (not from the initial 100 NOW).

Although, if the rate of the collateral currency reaches the liquidation level, the collateral will be automatically liquidated and the loan will be closed. It is impossible to return the collateral after liquidation – that’s why we will notify you multiple times when the current rate approaches the liquidation price."},"1":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_1-question_2","QUESTION":"What if the collateral’s currency rate changes after I get a loan?","ANSWER":"The collateral’s currency rate doesn’t affect the amount of the loan buyback at the time of closing. You will receive the exact amount of collateral for the exact amount you loaned (+ accumulated APR)"},"2":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_1-question_3","QUESTION":"What happens when I deposit my collateral to ChangeNOW?","ANSWER":"After your collateral deposit transaction is successfully confirmed, we process your funds through a risk management system. After the check, we initiate the loan payout transaction to the wallet you’ve entered when creating the loan. After your funds have reached you, your loan becomes active for as long as you’d like. All the APR you’ll accumulate is to be paid at the moment of collateral release."},"3":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_1-question_4","QUESTION":"How do you store my collateral?","ANSWER":"All the funds are stored in special wallets, and private keys are put in secure storage that can be accessed only by several IP addresses and through a VPN connection. Private keys for all the wallets are renewed every month. The risk control system checks all wallets’ balances every second."},"4":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_1-question_5","QUESTION":"How can I get my collateral back?","ANSWER":"You can get your collateral back anytime. To do that, you have to make your loan’s repayment. It consists of the amount loaned and the accumulated APR counted monthly during your loan period."},"5":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_1-question_6","QUESTION":"How is the collateral calculated?","ANSWER":"We work at a 50% loan-to-value ratio: if your collateral is 1 Bitcoin and it costs $60,000, you will get $30,000 in Tether. Why only 50%? At the 50% LTV, we guarantee we don’t sell your collateral before its price drops by 50%. If our LTV were 90%, we would give you a $54k loan for your $60k, but if the Bitcoin price dropped to $54k, we’d sell it. This is not safe. Low LTV secures your collateral from liquidation."},"6":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_1-question_7","QUESTION":"What happens if the market goes up and my collateral is worth more?","ANSWER":"When you repay the loan, we will return you the same amount of cryptocurrency as deposited. If your collateral size is 1 BTC, you will get back 1 BTC irrespective of its current market price. This is the fundamental value we provide: you can get some money now as a loan while your main long-term investment in crypto stays with you and keeps bringing you profits."}}},"1":{"CHAPTER_ID":"chapter_2","CHAPTER_HEADER":"Loans terms","CHAPTER_QUESTIONS":{"0":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_2-question_1","QUESTION":"How quickly can I get a loan? How quickly will you refund me the collateral?","ANSWER":{"0":"The average period of giving loans and releasing collaterals is 5-10 minutes, depending on how fast we receive your deposit.","1":"The current state of the network and the network fee size can influence the period of us receiving collaterals. Make sure to set an appropriate network fee so that the transaction is confirmed as fast as possible."}},"1":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_2-question_2","QUESTION":"How risky are ChangeNOW loans?","ANSWER":"You are to define your level of trust in the project. The service was launched with the support of Guarda Wallet, a company that has been known to be credible for years. If you need to make sure the service is safe and easy to use, you can always try it with small collateral. We are constantly taking steps to make the service more credible!"},"2":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_2-question_3","QUESTION":"What is the liquidation price?","ANSWER":"The liquidation price, or LP, is the collateral’s asset value at which we have to liquidate your loan. This amount is calculated due to us being able to compensate the issued loan if the collateral’s value drops in price significantly."},"3":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_2-question_4","QUESTION":"What are the limits for loans on your platform?","ANSWER":"We don’t have a maximum cap for loans – our liquidity provider allows us to make sure you can loan as much as you’d like. Minimal loan amounts vary by currency, however, it’s more or less around $100."},"4":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_2-question_5","QUESTION":"Can I close my loan at any time?","ANSWER":"Yes, there are no restrictions. You can close your loan in a month, a year, or even tomorrow and we’ll return your collateral with no questions. Note that for loans shorter than 30 days, there’s an extra closing $100 fee."},"5":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_2-question_6","QUESTION":"Can I have multiple loans?","ANSWER":"Sure, you can have multiple loans with different or the same collateral. You will track them as separate loans. When it comes to the repayment, interest, and fees are charged for each loan separately."},"6":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_2-question_7","QUESTION":"Where can I see the details about my loan(s)?","ANSWER":"At the top of the page, click “Track my loan”. Sign in with your phone number and see your loan data: the size of your deposit and the loan, the repayment amount, and the price chart showing how far your collateral is from the liquidation price."}}},"2":{"CHAPTER_ID":"chapter_3","CHAPTER_HEADER":"Rates, interests, and LTV","CHAPTER_QUESTIONS":{"0":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_3-question_1","QUESTION":"How much will I pay?","ANSWER":"The annual rate of interest is 10%. The interest is calculated monthly and is included in the repayment amount."},"1":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_3-question_2","QUESTION":"What’s your LTV?","ANSWER":{"0":"Our loan-to-value, or LTV, is set at 50% – that means that we give you 50% of the collateral value as a loan. This allows us to minimize your risks and protect you from the stark volatility of your collateral price.","1":"We are open to your feedback about our LTV and are planning on adding an option to set your own LTV in the future."}},"2":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_3-question_3","QUESTION":"I have a better rate offered by a competitor. Can you match it?","ANSWER":"Our interest rate is one of the lowest on the market. More than that, there are no requirements to store our token to get better Loan conditions like many of our competitors do. All the conditions are transparent from the start. If you have thoughts on how we could offer you better service — feel free to contact our support 24/7. We will find a loan solution that fits you best."}}},"3":{"CHAPTER_ID":"chapter_4","CHAPTER_HEADER":"Supported assets","CHAPTER_QUESTIONS":{"0":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_4-question_1","QUESTION":"What assets does ChangeNOW support?","ANSWER":"We support several original coins for collateral deposits: BTC, ETH, BCH, NANO, DOGE, FIRO, XRP, and DGB, as well as several Ethereum tokens. For loans, you can receive either USDT or USDC. The list of available assets is constantly expanding, and more currencies are going to be supported soon."},"1":{"QUESTION_ID":"chapter_4-question_2","QUESTION":"I want to deposit an asset that you don’t support yet.
