If you don’t agree with these Terms or any of its Clauses, you shall immediately cease to use our services.</p>
<h3 id="1-general-provisions">1. General Provisions</h3>
<p>1.1. These Terms regulate relations pertaining to the using of the website <a href="/">https://changenow.io</a> (hereinafter – “Website”).</p>
<p>1.2. The following terminology applies to these Terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“User”</strong>, <strong>“You”</strong> and <strong>“Your”</strong> refers to you, the natural person (individual) accessing the Website, using our services through the Website and accepting these Terms.</li>
<li><strong>“ChangeNOW”</strong>, <strong>“Services”</strong>, <strong>“Ourselves”</strong>, <strong>“We”,</strong> and <strong>“Us”</strong> refers to the company CHN Group LLC., duly organized under the laws of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.</li>
<li><strong>“Party”</strong> refers to either you or us. For the avoidance of any doubt, the contracting Parties under these Terms are you and ChangeNOW.</li>
<li><strong>“Digital Asset”</strong>, <strong>“Cryptocurrency”</strong> refer to blockchain-based software ledger data entries.</li>
<li><strong>“Exchange”</strong> means the swap of a crypto asset for another or the same one crypto asset, or the conversion of a fiat currency to cryptocurrency and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Crypto Assets&quot;</strong> means a type of assets that can be transferred only and exclusively using blockchain technology, including, but not limited to digital coins and digital tokens, and any other digital mediums of exchange.</li>
<li><strong>“Classic Rate Exchange”</strong> means a classic rate cryptocurrency exchange performed at the current most profitable rate on the market, at which the Service does not guarantee this rate.</li>
<li><strong>“Fixed Rate Exchange”</strong> means an exchange performed at the same rate which is displayed to the client at the beginning of an exchange, regardless of subsequent rate fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.3. These Terms are open and public document. The current effective version of the Terms is located <a href="../terms-of-use/">here</a>.</p>
<p>1.4. In these Terms, unless otherwise specified, the words importing the singular include the plural and vice versa, and the words importing gender include all genders.</p>
<p>1.5. The user accepts that the Terms of Use may be updated by ChangeNOW at any time. If the user does not read and accept the Terms of Service, the User should not use or continue using the Services.</p>
<h3 id="2-using-of-services">2. Using of Services</h3>
<p>2.1. By using the website, you accept these Terms and agree that you are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, and regulations.</p>
<p>2.2. Accepting the terms of the classic Exchange option, also called &quot;Classic Rate Exchange,&quot; means you acknowledge and agree that the information about the Exchange rates for the classic rate option is indicative and may differ slightly from the actual Exchange rate.</p>
<p>The following may be offered if the cryptocurrency market changes significantly during the Exchange:</p>
<ul>
<li>To proceed with the exchange at the current market rate.</li>
<li>To refund the non-exchanged crypto assets to the original address or to the refund address after deducting fees, and send the exchanged funds to the payout address after conversion into the asset specified at the exchange creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.3. By using the &quot;Fixed Exchange Rate&quot; you acknowledge and agree that the fixed exchange rate may differ from the classic exchange rate.</p>
<p>ChangeNOW shall complete the exchange if the following requirements are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>We received the crypto asset in a short time after the User created the exchange. It is important to note that a payment transmitted to the blockchain network does not mean that ChangeNOW accepts this payment. The number of payment confirmations is determined by us depending on the blockchain.</li>
<li>The user sent the crypto asset to a specially generated address on the exchange page. Addresses for each exchange are disposable and cannot be used again.</li>
<li>The user sent the exact amount that was displayed on the website, as well as took into account all relevant withdrawal fees and network fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the situation allows for an exchange, the transaction will be made at the rate that was confirmed by the user at the beginning of the exchange.</p>
<p>If the market situation is such that the transaction cannot be executed anymore, the crypto assets will be refunded, if possible, less all applicable fees.</p>
<p>If the user sends an amount higher than was specified and confirmed by the user before the creation of the exchange, the transaction shall be made in accordance with the rules of Classic Rate Exchange.</p>
<p>2.4. When you exchange crypto assets, you acknowledge and agree that we cooperate with third-party liquidity providers, and we can use their services to complete the exchange.</p>
<p>2.5. For the exchange via our Services, our system automatically generates a one-time address.</p>
<p>2.6. The Website provides non-custodial services, which means that we do not store your Digital Assets on deposits and balances.</p>

<p>2.9 . In order to protect the integrity of the Website, ChangeNOW reserves the right at any time in its sole discretion to block users who violate these Terms.</p>
<h3 id="3-amlkyc-procedure">3. AML/KYC Procedure</h3>
<p>3.1. The Users don’t need to create accounts: you don’t need to register or log in to use the Website.
However, ChangeNOW uses an automated risk management system to check all the transactions made by the Users.</p>
<p>3.2. By accepting these Terms you agree to pass through the AML/KYC procedure, which may be applied to you or may be requested by ChangeNOW at any time.</p>
<p>3.3. During the AML/KYC procedure, ChangeNOW reserves the right to request additional information and documents, including but not limited to scan of your ID document valid in your country and additional information of the funds&#39; origin.</p>
<p>3.4. In limited cases (such as to verify your identity in order to pass the AML/KYC procedure), we reserve the right to freeze your exchange transaction for any period of time necessary to complete the investigation and AML/KYC procedure.</p>
<p>While the investigation is ongoing, ChangeNOW reserves the right to transfer the frozen funds to a cold storage. It would be done for ensuring their safekeeping.</p>
<p>3.5. If you deny to pass through the AML/KYC procedure or don’t provide ChangeNOW with the requested documents and information, ChangeNOW has the right to refuse to execute your transactions (current and future).</p>
<p>3.6. By accepting these Terms, you agree and warrant to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and take full responsibility for its accuracy, completeness and veracity.</p>
<p>3.7. For more information, read the official ChangeNOW&#39;s Rules of Anti-Money Laundering and Combating The Financing Terrorism Compliance Control <a href="../files/Rules_of_AML_CFT_compliance_ChangeNow.v1.6.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>3.8. Starting June 2021, ChangeNOW works with a KYC provider called SumSub.</p>
<p>3.8.1. If a User’s exchange has been stopped for a KYC check due to an alert from ChangeNOW’s risk-management system, ChangeNOW provides the User with a link where they can pass the verification procedure in a safe and secure manner.</p>
<p>3.8.2. The verification time window is 3 days, and the User can refuse to pass the procedure; in that case, the User will be provided with a refund.</p>
<p>In limited cases (if the transaction is suspected of being connected to illegal activities) we reserve the right to freeze your exchange transaction for any period of time necessary to complete the investigation and AML/KYC procedure.</p>
<h3 id="4-personal-data">4. Personal Data</h3>
<p>4.1. By accepting these Terms, you expressly allow ChangeNOW to process your personal data, export your personal data outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside or are located.</p>
<p>4.2. We are entitled to transfer some User’s data (including IP-addresses) to our business partners or governmental bodies at their request to facilitate the prevention and disclosure of prohibited or illegal actions. By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge and agree to your personal data may be transferred in this way.</p>
<p>4.3. For more information, read the official ChangeNOW&#39;s Privacy Policy <a href="../privacy-policy/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="5-prices-exchange-rates-and-confirmations">5. Prices, Exchange Rates and Confirmations</h3>
<p>5.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are highly experimental and risky.</p>
<p>5.2. ChangeNOW’s conversion service attempts to provide accurate price and exchange rate information, but this information is highly volatile and can change quickly without Users necessarily being aware of these changes.</p>
<p>5.3. For normal orders, the exchange rate you receive is calculated at the time your payment is accepted. Due to varying security between blockchain, your payment is typically considered “accepted” at six blocks confirmation. It is important to note that a payment being broadcast to the blockchain network does not constitute an acceptance by ChangeNOW of that payment.</p>
<p>5.4. The ChangeNOW’s interest (the ChangeNOW’s remuneration for the using of its services and the Website) is included in the final rate of the User’s change transactions. You don’t need to pay additional fees directly to the ChangeNOW, unless otherwise provided by these Terms.</p>
<p>5.5. Please, contact the customer support (<a href="/#eec8cddfdfdbd5c8cddfdfd9d5c8cd96d9ded5c8cd96d9ded5c8cd96d888d5c8cd96d9dcd5c8cddfdfd8d5c8cd96daded5c8cdd7d7d5c8cddfdedad5c8cd96d8dfd5c8cd96d88bd5c8cd96d8d9d5c8cd96d8dbd5c8cd96d88bd5c8cddfdfdfd5c8cddfdfd7d5c8cddad8d5c8cd96d8d7d5c8cddfdfdfd5">&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x40;&#99;&#104;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x65;&#x6e;&#111;&#119;&#46;&#x69;&#111;</a>) for more information on exchange rates and prices.</p>
<p>5.6. Please note that for blockchain technology, network fees are subject to change.

The hard copy of the request should be sent to our postal address: Newtonlaan 115, Utrecht, 3584 BH, Netherlands.

<p>6.13. Fake tokens or Imitation tokens mean tokens that have no value. Despite mimicking the existing project and having the same name or logo, such tokens do not have the contract address of the project.

In case of receiving Fake tokens or Imitation tokens to its deposit address, ChangeNOW shall not exchange or return such tokens.</p>

During the AML/KYC procedure, ChangeNOW reserves the right to request additional information and documents, including but not limited to scan of your ID document valid in your country and additional information of the funds&#39; origin.</p>\n<p>3.4. In limited cases (such as to verify your identity in order to pass the AML/KYC procedure), we reserve the right to freeze your exchange transaction for any period of time necessary to complete the investigation and AML/KYC procedure.</p>\n<p>While the investigation is ongoing, ChangeNOW reserves the right to transfer the frozen funds to a cold storage.

Prices, Exchange Rates and Confirmations</h3>\n<p>5.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are highly experimental and risky.</p>\n<p>5.2. ChangeNOW’s conversion service attempts to provide accurate price and exchange rate information, but this information is highly volatile and can change quickly without Users necessarily being aware of these changes.</p>\n<p>5.3. For normal orders, the exchange rate you receive is calculated at the time your payment is accepted. Due to varying security between blockchain, your payment is typically considered “accepted” at six blocks confirmation. It is important to note that a payment being broadcast to the blockchain network does not constitute an acceptance by ChangeNOW of that payment.</p>\n<p>5.4. The ChangeNOW’s interest (the ChangeNOW’s remuneration for the using of its services and the Website) is included in the final rate of the User’s change transactions. You don’t need to pay additional fees directly to the ChangeNOW, unless otherwise provided by these Terms.</p>\n<p>5.5. Please, contact the customer support (<a href=\"mailto:&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x40;&#99;&#104;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x65;&#x6e;&#111;&#119;&#46;&#x69;&#111;\">&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x40;&#99;&#104;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x65;&#x6e;&#111;&#119;&#46;&#x69;&#111;</a>) for more information on exchange rates and prices.</p>\n<p>5.6. Please note that for blockchain technology, network fees are subject to change. If you make a deposit more than 30 minutes after your exchange has been created, or send a deposit amount that differs from the one specified during the exchange&#39;s creation, we cannot guarantee that the network fees will not affect the amount of cryptocurrency you will receive.</p>\n<p>5.7. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the changes you complete via the Website and our services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

The outgoing Digital Asset will be exchanged and sent to the User if the “Order Status” page indicates a successful exchange by displaying “Done” or “Completed”.</p>\n<p>6.5. Any decisions by ChangeNOW with respect to refunds or exchanges are final. </p>\n<p>6.6. Please, note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All transactions from ChangeNOW to the User’s outgoing Digital Asset wallet shall be subject to all posted fees, including but not limited to miner fees.</li>\n<li>The Digital Assets extraction process can take up to twenty (20) business days.

If your funds are deposited in a TXID with more than one (1) deposit, you will need to contact support to receive a refund. The exchange rate will not be honored and your exchange cannot be completed.</li>\n<li>WARNING: There are fake websites pretending to be ChangeNOW’s Website (aka “phishing scams”). They use a misspelled URL that looks like “changenow.io” in order to trick the Users into sending them funds. DO NOT USE ANY SERVICE THAT ISN&#39;T EXACTLY LOCATED AT THE DOMAIN: “ChangeNOW.io”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ChangeNOW is not responsible for funds that have been sent to these fake phishing sites. It is important that all Users shall verify they are visiting the correct URL (ChangeNOW.io) on their own and search for the security certificate in the URL bar of their browser.</p>\n<p>Also, never trust private messages, solicitations or requests for funds from people claiming to be ChangeNOW unless you have verified that it is an official request from a ChangeNOW’s employee.</p>\n<p>In case of doubt, contact us directly to verify any messaging. Stay diligent - and please report any phishing scams to our team (<a href=\"mailto:&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#112;&#x6c;&#105;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x63;&#x65;&#x40;&#99;&#104;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x67;&#101;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#119;&#x2e;&#105;&#x6f;\">&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#112;&#x6c;&#105;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x63;&#x65;&#x40;&#99;&#104;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x67;&#101;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#119;&#x2e;&#105;&#x6f;</a>).</p>\n<p>6.7. If there are dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency market, ChangeNOW can not exchange Cryptocurrency on the fix rate. In this case ChangeNOW shall carry out exchange transactions at the market rate or return the Cryptocurrency to the User at the choice of the latter.\nThe Parties agree that under “dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency market” they understand the changes in the cryptocurrency rates equal to 3% or higher in any direction.</p>\n<p>6.8. If there are any changes in the cryptocurrency market and the User decided to take any advantages of the Website&#39;s vulnerability, ChangeNOW can not complete the exchange transactions of such User and shall return him or her the Cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>6.9. If you accidentally sent BCH to a SegWit BTC address that belongs to ChangeNOW, we will be able to make a refund if the amount sent is equivalent to or exceeds 60 US dollars. The fee of such operation will be 15% of the amount, but not less than 50 US dollars deducted from the BCH deposit. We cannot guarantee the possibility of returning assets other than BCH sent to the SegWit BTC address.

In such cases, we will be able to return the funds in the asset to which the exchange was made (to-currency).</p>\n<p>In order to return such funds, ChangeNOW will need a request of a Law Enforcement Authority, which clearly states that the mentioned funds should be returned. The hard copy of the request should be sent to our postal address: Newtonlaan 115, Utrecht, 3584 BH, Netherlands. Please send a digital copy of the request to <a href=\"mailto:&#99;&#111;&#x6d;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x61;&#110;&#x63;&#101;&#64;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#x67;&#x65;&#x6e;&#111;&#x77;&#46;&#x69;&#111;\">&#99;&#111;&#x6d;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x61;&#110;&#x63;&#101;&#64;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#x67;&#x65;&#x6e;&#111;&#x77;&#46;&#x69;&#111;</a> before sending the hard one.</p>\n<p>Once the hard copy is received, we can issue a refund to an initial or refund address specified in the exchange within 3 business days.</p>\n<p>6.12.

However, ChangeNOW shall not be responsible for the result. All the fees charged for return transactions shall be paid by the User.</p>\n<p>6.13. Fake tokens or Imitation tokens mean tokens that have no value. Despite mimicking the existing project and having the same name or logo, such tokens do not have the contract address of the project.

In case of receiving Fake tokens or Imitation tokens to its deposit address, ChangeNOW shall not exchange or return such tokens.</p>\n<p>6.14.
