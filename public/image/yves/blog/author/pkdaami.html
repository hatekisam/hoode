Even as a newbie in the blockchain space, chances are you’ve heard about the Solana ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The network touts itself as the most performant permissionless blockchain globally, but with the crypto industry’s growth, it can be hard to keep up with all the new developments. Let’s explore Solana’s ins and outs and its evolution from its inception in 2017 up to 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-solana\">What is Solana?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-solana-blockchain\">Introducing the Solana Blockchain</h3>\n<p><strong>Solana</strong> is a blockchain platform that is designed to host decentralized and scalable applications. It is an open-source network, which means that developers can build and launch their own decentralized applications using it. Solana initially emerged as a rival to the Ethereum (<a href=\"link\">ETH</a>) blockchain. Like the latter, it offers smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s other core features include its high speed, with the potential to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, and low transaction costs averaging at $0.00025. Transaction fees on Solana are in the network’s native token, <a href=\"link\">SOL</a>.</p>\n<p>The Solana coin is a utility token that functions as a medium of exchange and helps prop up security on the platform via staking. The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former executive at Qualcomm, in 2017 and is currently run by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-solana\">A brief history of Solana</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-and-why-solana-was-created\">How and why Solana was created</h3>\n<p>Solana emerged in response to the scalability limitations of existing blockchain platforms such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BTC</a>) and Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Bitcoin price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believed that agreement on time was one of the biggest challenges of a distributed model.</p>\n<p>Yakovenko recognized that a reliable and accurate clock was crucial for network synchronization. As such, he began working on and developed the concept of <a href=\"link\">proof of history</a>. This technique allows for keeping time between untrusted computers, making network synchronization simpler and faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-exactly-is-solanas-proof-of-history\">What exactly is Solana’s proof of history?</h3>\n<p>The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism is Solana’s chosen technique to keep the time between computers that do not trust each other. The basic idea behind PoH is to use a &quot;timestamp&quot; that is generated by a central server and broadcast to all nodes on the network. This timestamp serves as a reference point for the network, allowing all nodes to agree on the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_26_18_PM_b5d4d80061.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.26.18 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"link\">Medium</a> </p>\n<p>To generate the timestamp, the central server creates a &quot;hash&quot; of a large amount of data (known as a &quot;PoH generator&quot;) and publishes it to the network. Each node on the network can then use this hash to verify the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p>The PoH generator is designed to be computationally expensive to create, ensuring it can only be generated by a central server and not by any individual node on the network. This helps to prevent any one node from manipulating the timestamp or the sequence of events.</p>\n<p>By using the PoH mechanism, Solana can achieve high levels of network synchronization and scalability, allowing it to process a large number of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement over other blockchain systems that lack a reliable clock and struggle to scale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-journey-to-the-solana-launch-yakovenkos-path\">The journey to the Solana launch: Yakovenko’s path</h3>\n<p>Solana was technically created in November 2017 when Anatoly Yakovenko published the whitepaper for the proof-of-history concept. This technique would serve as the foundation for the Solana project. With plans to weave all the world&#39;s transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called it Loom.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald <a href=\"link\">published</a> the first open-source implementation of the PoH technique on GitHub under the name Silk. The project quickly gained traction, and the team continued to develop it.</p>\n<p>By March 2018, the team rebranded the project as Solana, a nod to the small beach town where Yakovenko and his team lived and worked. In June of that same year, they had scaled the technology to run on cloud-based networks. The next month, they published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>After months of testing and development, the Solana mainnet went live on March 31, 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-price-evolution\">Solana price evolution</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-is-solana-worth\">How much is Solana worth?</h3>\n<p>Solana’s SOL token, like most cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price fluctuations. In the first few months after the launch, the Solana price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1.00.</p>\n<p>However, in late 2020, the price of Solana began to rise rapidly. Driven by the non-fungible token (NFT) hype and the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. SOL more than tripled to a peak of $18.00 in early 2021. Solana reached its all-time high of $258 in November 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_40_45_PM_ff2553a118.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.40.45 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Solana price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these gains were nearly wiped out by the end of last year due to the crypto crash and subsequent contagion. Solana’s price took a hard hit from FTX’s implosion due to its close association with the exchange and subsidiaries. SOL dropped under $10 in late December for the first time since February 2021. However, it has recovered in the past month to trade at $24.22 currently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-solana-coins-are-there\">How many Solana coins are there?</h3>\n<p>The Solana foundation revealed that the total number of Solana (SOL) coins to enter circulation is 489 million. At the moment, 260 million tokens are available on the market. </p>\n<h3 id=\"where-can-you-buy-solana\">Where can you buy Solana?</h3>\n<p>Solana (SOL) can be purchased on a variety of exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and <a href=\"link\">ChangeNow</a>. With a user-friendly interface and a wide variety of payment options, ChangeNow makes it easy for anyone to purchase SOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanas-major-developments\">Solana’s major developments</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2019\">Solana’s 2019</h3>\n<p>Right before the Solana mainnet launch, much of the team’s attention was on obtaining funding to develop its new crypto network. The project had already begun to gain traction.</p>\n<p>As such, the team was able to raise $20 million in a private token sale led by Multicoin Capital in Q1 2019. Other participants were Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2020\">Solana’s 2020</h3>\n<p>The year 2020 marked Solana’s emergence as the first blockchain to use proof of history. The platform launched on Mainnet Beta in March 2020, following successful fundraising and the launch of their public test network, Tour de SOL.</p>\n<p>That same year, <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href=\"link\">USDT</a>) launched Solana-native <strong>USDT</strong> and Circle partnered to make <strong><a href=\"link\">USDC</a></strong> a native stablecoin on the platform. Solana also held its first hackathon from October 28 to November 14.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Tether price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2021\">Solana’s 2021</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s 2020 hackathon and subsequent ones were a success, leading to an influx of developers and projects onto the platform. By December 2021, Solana had exceeded 1,000 projects and saw a significant rise in its price and daily active users. This propelled the SOL token to the fifth spot on the crypto list, surpassing <strong>Cardano</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<p>However, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for 17 hours. The platform had formerly gone down for 6 hours in December 2021, earning it a reputation for frequent outages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Cardano price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2022\">Solana’s 2022</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s outage problem persisted into 2022. Despite this, the network was able to make some progress. Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, announced integration with Ethereum and Polygon. In June, Solana revealed plans for the first crypto smartphone, the Solana Saga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/solana_saga_01_7aaaabbbc6.jpg\" alt=\"solana-saga_01.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>The platform also opened a physical store in New York City dedicated to all things crypto in July. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Solana_just_launched_a_physical_store_in_metaverse_79dcec4278.jpg\" alt=\"Solana-just-launched-a-physical-store-in-metaverse.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>Notably, Solana&#39;s NFT market experienced substantial growth in 2022, with the number of minted NFTs reaching 312,000 on September 7. Additionally, Solana NFT trading volumes rose to hit $11.5 million on September 6.</p>\n<p>However, in August, the platform&#39;s mobile wallet suffered a hack resulting in $8 million worth of losses. Thousands of Solana users suffered in the attack, which Solana ultimately blamed on a third-party platform, the Slope mobile wallet app. Solana experienced more losses later on as the FTX and Alameda saga caused the single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics as SOL dipped 96%. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solana-ecosystem\">The Solana ecosystem</h3>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem is home to a diverse range of projects, from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The platform’s speed, affordability, and scalability mean it is quickly becoming a go-to destination for developers, entrepreneurs, and users who want to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications and services. </p>\n<p>Among these projects are <strong>Phantom</strong>, a decentralized social network that empowers users to share content, earn rewards, and connect with others; <strong>Stepn</strong> (<a href=\"link\">GMT</a>), a platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows artists and creators to monetize their work. Solana also hosts <strong>Star Atlas</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ATLAS</a>), a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading digital assets, and <strong>Audius</strong>, initially built on Ethereum but moved to Solana in 2020, a decentralized streaming platform for musicians that enables them to control their music and earn royalties directly from fans.</p>\n<p>More recently, <strong>BONK</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BONK</a>),  “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people,” which was released in December 2020. </p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Like most other projects in the crypto industry, Solana reaped the benefits of 2021’s DeFi and NFT boom. In the same vein, it was unable to escape the impact of the crypto winter in 2022. Still, its attractive blend of speed and affordability, thanks to its unique technology, makes it a staple for most developers in this space. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest SOL trading pairs <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Also Read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/analyst-predicts-sols-price-prior-to-solanas-milestone-conference\">Analyst Predicts SOL’s Price Prior to Solana’s Conference</a></li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-26T19:28:00.275Z","createdAt":"2023-01-26T18:47:45.949Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-02T10:18:16.163Z"},{"id":1366,"title":"ChangeNOW stands against fraudulent actions amid Alameda wallets' suspicious activity","description":"Taking into account the company's high AML standards in terms of resistance to illegal activity, ChangeNOW is putting serious effort into preventing such incidents as the recent Alameda wallets’ case.","slug":"changenow-stands-against-fraudulent-actions-ensures-high-compliance-standards-amid-alameda-wallets-suspicious-activity","metaTitle":"ChangeNOW position amid Alameda suspicious activity","metaDescription":"The compliance team works round-the-clock with investigation inquiries related to Alameda funds movement","featuredImage":{"id":6782,"name":"12.28 Alameda Incident Statement-01.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Once fraudulent activity was first reported by investigators, the ChangeNOW compliance team responded immediately and blocklisted suspicious wallets.

It was originally called Bitrise, and the native coin was branded BRISE. In December 2021, it rebranded to Bitgert but the name change did not affect the name of the coin. </p>\n<p>In 2022, Bitgert launched its own blockchain network instead of relying on BSC. BRISE remains the native coin of this blockchain and is used to pay gas fees. It markets itself as a blockchain with “zero gas fees” and one capable of performing up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-bitgert\">What Is Bitgert?</h2>\n<p>Bitgert is a blockchain that markets itself as highly affordable, fast, and scalable. It claims to be a “zero gas fee” blockchain but the fact is that there are some minute transaction fees, typically a fraction of a cent. The fees are paid with the BRISE coin.</p>\n<p>Bitgert operates on a “proof of authority” consensus algorithm. This mechanism is based on identities, meaning that assigned block validators are not staking tokens but instead their reputations. It is scalable because it relies on a limited number of validators, and transactions are verified by participants acting as moderators. </p>\n<p>The team behind the Bitgert blockchain runs three main products; the <strong>Bitgert exchange</strong>, <strong>Bitgert P2P exchange</strong>, and payment gateway <strong>PayBRISE</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>The Bitgert exchange</em></strong> works like any other crypto exchange; you can buy or sell different coin pairs, e.g., ETH/BTC and BTC/USDT. </li>\n<li><strong><em>The P2P platform</em></strong> works like a typical exchange but with users trading directly with each other. </li>\n<li><strong><em>PayBRISE</em></strong> is a platform that lets merchants accept BRISE as payment for their services, with little fees and instant transaction settlement. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Bitgert ecosystem also hosts many other external projects ranging from staking platforms to decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and more. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bitgert-brise-fundamental-analysis\">Bitgert (BRISE) Fundamental Analysis</h2>\n<p>BRISE has one of the biggest supplies. Over 1,000,000,000,000,000 tokens have been created, and over 395,000,000,000,000 are currently in circulation. </p>\n<p>Despite its enormous supply, the total market value of BRISE tokens amounts to just over $200 million, which is relatively small compared to other tokens. There is still big room for growth. </p>\n<p>How high this token can grow depends on many factors, and the first is the performance of the Bitgert blockchain. If more developers flock to the Bitgert blockchain to build decentralized apps, then you can expect BRISE to appreciate, because it is the native token used for payments on this blockchain. If Bitgert sees slow adoption, then BRISE will see slow growth.</p>\n<p>The Bitgert exchange and peer-to-peer platform also play major roles in the performance of the BRISE token. These are the two main projects built on the Bitgert blockchain, and developers are watching their performance to see if the Bitgert blockchain is worth adopting. There is also PayBRISE, which lets online retailers accept BRISE as payment; if more merchants adopt this payment processor, BRISE will likely grow.  </p>\n<p>BRISE has good utility within the Bitgert blockchain. However, there are some factors weighing on its growth, including the fact that its founders remain anonymous; developers may not trust the blockchain when they are not sure of the team behind it. </p>\n<h2 id=\"brise-price-history\">BRISE Price History</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/image2_0a63c47bb7.png\" alt=\"image2.png\" >\nSource: CoinMarketCap</p>\n<p>The Bitgert project launched in 2021 under its former name Bitrise. The BRISE token launched on July 6, 2021, on Pancake Swap, a popular decentralized exchange. It was priced at $0.000000008 apiece, meaning $8 could get 1 billion tokens.</p>\n<p>The BRISE coin rose sharply immediately after its launch, reaching an all-time high of $0.0000404, but fell afterward. It then remained flat for several months due to low interest but began rising around October 2021 although not to the level of its previous peak.</p>\n<p>Increased interest around November 2021 saw the coin increase to $0.0000006291, still below its previous peak level. In December 2021, Bitrise rebranded to Bitgert, and the price fell sharply, reaching as low as $0.00000003895.</p>\n<p>BRISE enjoyed good fortunes in the early months of 2022. It reached $0.00000184 in March of the same year, another peak, and began dropping steadily. The next peak came in September 2022 when it reached $0.000001103. Since then, it has dropped steadily and has not recovered to that level. </p>\n<p>This token currently trades at around $0.0000005500 apiece. The very small unit price owes to the fact that there are 1 quadrillion tokens in circulation, one of the highest of any cryptocurrency. It has a current market value of over $200 million and a daily trading volume of around $10 million, according to <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitrise-token/\">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bitgert-brise-technical-analysis\">Bitgert (BRISE) Technical Analysis</h2>\n<p>Here are some important statistics to guide the technical analysis of this coin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It hit an all-time high of $0.0000404 in August 2021 before listing on various mainstream exchanges.</li>\n<li>After listing, its highest peak was $0.00000184 in March 2022.</li>\n<li>Daily trading volume has increased over 600% from the 1st of January 2023 to late February 2023. In that same period, the price increased from $0.0000003056 to around $0.0000005500, an 80% jump. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/image1_f43ff71595.png\" alt=\"image1.png\" >\n2023 year-to-date chart (Source: CoinMarketCap)</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Despite this year’s sharp increase, the average daily trading volume and the price remain down from their peak in March 2022.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The chart displayed above indicates a bullish pattern for the coin this year. It sharply dropped in January but recovered and rose back up in February and has remained significantly above its January price. The price movement indicates that BRISE might continue to rise in the short and long term in 2023. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bitgert-brise-price-prediction-2023\">Bitgert (BRISE) Price Prediction 2023</h2>\n<p>According to WalletInvestor, BRISE is expected to hit a peak price of $0.000001 in 2023 and end the year at around $0.000000599. According to DigitalCoinPrice, the coin is expected to stay at an average price of $0.000001 in 2023, about double its current price. According to CoinCodex, this token is a Strong Buy throughout 2023, with 84% of investors bullish and just 16% bearish. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bitgert-brise-price-prediction-2024\">Bitgert (BRISE) Price Prediction 2024</h2>\n<p>According to WalletInvestor, BRISE could average $0.0000002 in the first half of 2024 and dip to around $0.0000001 in the second half. According to DigitalCoinPrice, there is a possibility for the coin to surpass $0.00000141 in 2024, much higher than its current level.

It offers a secure, scalable, interoperable, and reliable environment that is also censorship-resistant and cost-effective for developers. Some of the network&#39;s success can be attributed to its active partnerships with other blockchain projects. Let&#39;s delve deeper into the <a href=\"https://runonflux.io/\">Flux ecosystem</a> and the opportunities it presents for developers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/02_01_What_is_FLUX_01_aeba9ed82c.png\" alt=\"02.01 What is FLUX-01.png\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"about-flux-flux\">About Flux (FLUX)</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://fluxofficial.medium.com/flux-a-unique-player-in-blockchain-c76b51502113\">primary goal</a> of the Flux ecosystem is to provide ease of access to the Web3 space. With more than 15,000 functional nodes it is the largest decentralized network globally. Flux is also the most affordable cloud provider available with deployment costs up to 10 times lower than centralized providers like AWS or Google Cloud.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disrupting-centralized-structures\">Disrupting Centralized Structures</h3>\n<p>Flux’s main feature is its decentralization, as stated earlier, its core values center around promoting a truly decentralized Web 3.0. Flux was created to address the issue of centralized control of data by a few powerful companies. </p>\n<p>Flux allows node operators to run their own nodes on personal hardware or a virtual private server. The platform also offers community node providers like Hostnodes and GoldieTech for those who want a home-hosted option. In return, they are rewarded for their contributions, with 50% of the total block reward going back to the community.</p>\n<p>Being truly decentralized ensures the network does not have a single point of failure. In addition to the absence of a single pressure point, Flux users also get to enjoy 100% uptime. </p>\n<p>Flux is powered by the utility token <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/flux\">FLUX</a> which serves a series of purposes on the platform. It can be used to purchase resources, collateralize nodes, and fuel transactions on Flux’s second-layer operating system FluxOS. FLUX is also used to reward both miners and node operators for providing computational resources. The platform offers other ways to earn rewards such as airdrops, and mining on the main and parallel chains with a 1:10 ratio. Community engagement on Discord can also yield returns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flux-flux-team\">Flux (FLUX) Team</h2>\n<p>According to the Flux website, the <a href=\"https://runonflux.io/team.html\">team</a> is a decentralized group of volunteers and leaders committed to the platform’s core goal. The Flux network has 3 co-founders each of whom brings their own unique skills and experience to the project. </p>\n<p>At the helm of the team is Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Daniel Keller. With over 25 years of experience in technology infrastructure, operations, and large-scale project leadership, Keller brings a wealth of knowledge to the Flux team. </p>\n<p>Co-Founder number 2 Tadeas Kmenta has been an integral part of the Flux project since its inception. As the Chief Innovations Officer, he is focused on the emergence and development of new solutions within Flux and FluxOS. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Parker Honeyman, the third Co-Founder of Flux, functions as Chief Operations Officer and Engineer. Honeyman brings a combination of technical know-how and proven development processes to the project. </p>\n<h2 id=\"flux-flux-roadmap\">Flux (FLUX) Roadmap</h2>\n<p>Flux has been in development for the past 3 years. As such the timeline for the official Flux <a href=\"https://runonflux.io/roadmap.html\">roadmap</a> covers the years  2020 to 2023. In the roadmap, the Flux team outlines plans for each quarter of the respective years. The project is now in the first quarter of 2023 and core parts of the roadmap for this period include; </p>\n<p><strong>WordPress, Storage, and Jetpack 3.0</strong>: Flux is working on integrating WordPress with its decentralized storage solution, Jetpack 3.0, to provide a fully decentralized WordPress platform for users.</p>\n<p><strong>Fractus Cumulus Storage Nodes Reward</strong>s: Flux is introducing a rewards program for Fractus Cumulus storage nodes, incentivizing users to provide storage space to the network.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized WordPress for the Public</strong>: Flux will be making its decentralized WordPress platform available to the public, allowing anyone to create and host their WordPress site on the decentralized network.</p>\n<p><strong>FluxOS Mobile App v0.1.2</strong>: A new version of the FluxOS mobile app will be released, providing users with improved functionality such as the OS for the Flux Web3 Cloud backend, an easy management tool for all FluxNodes supporting the Flux Cloud - a dashboard, statistics and more, all adding up to a better user experience. </p>\n<p><strong>Fiat Payment For Flux Cloud Services</strong>: Flux will be introducing the ability for users to pay for its cloud services using fiat currency.</p>\n<p><strong>XDAO 2.0 Proposal to community</strong>: Flux will be proposing a new version of its XDAO governance model to the community for feedback and input.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Pricing Structure</strong>: Flux will be implementing a dynamic pricing structure for its cloud services, allowing users to pay based on their usage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q2---q4-2023\">Q2 - Q4 2023</h3>\n<p>Further down the year Flux also intends to host a Flux Hackathon to encourage developers to build on the ecosystem. The First Flux Conference is also in the works for Q2 of this year. The platform will put measures in place to reduce carbon footprint across online platforms. Notably, this is already one of Flux’s ongoing projects.</p>\n<p>Flux is working on <a href=\"https://fluxofficial.medium.com/flux-and-a-sustainable-future-in-blockchain-and-cloud-computing-9669b124a49d#:~:text=Flux%20is%20actively%20developing%20sustainable,solutions%20than%20legacy%20technology%20can.\">sustainable solutions</a> for proof of work and cloud computing. They aim to use energy responsibly through active development and innovation in emerging technology and blockchain. The platform has implemented Proof-of-Useful-Work as a consensus method for a sustainable way of mining cryptocurrency. This approach uses computational power for solving real-world problems while securing the blockchain, resulting in less power and fewer carbon emissions. PoUW not only provides an alternative to crypto mining but also transforms the way we consume and use resources.</p>\n<p>Q3 of this year will see Flux commence the proof-of-concept phase for its Proof of Useful Work consensus mechanism. In the final months of the year, the platform will launch its Flux University and also hold the Flux Hackathon 2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flux-flux-network\">Flux (FLUX) Network</h2>\n<h3 id=\"flux-chain\">Flux Chain</h3>\n<p>Flux is a multi-chain cloud infrastructure provider, utilizing its core blockchain and connections to seven other chains. These are, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/binance-coin-smart-chain\">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/kadena\">Kadena (KDA)</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/solana\">Solana (SOL)</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tron\">Tron (TRX)</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/avalanche\">Avalanche (AVAX)</a>, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ergo\">Ergo (ERG)</a>, with plans to add three more in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flux-parallel-assets\">Flux Parallel Assets</h3>\n<p>Flux is gunning to become the leading network, a pioneer in the Web3 space. However, to do this an interoperable ecosystem is a necessity. Acknowledging this led the team to the <a href=\"https://fluxofficial.medium.com/exploring-parallel-assets-in-the-flux-ecosystem-ea40012429d0\">concept</a> of parallel assets. Before this Flux’s native FLUX coin was performing well but it was limited to the Flux blockchain. </p>\n<p>With parallel assets, other blockchains can host Flux equivalents.  Parallel assets work similarly to token bridges, enabling assets to be transferred between different blockchains. These assets are fully compatible with other networks while still bringing aboard Flux’s unique features. Flux’s parallel assets feature allows developers to easily run their applications on a variety of major blockchains. This opens up access to DeFi services and eliminates the risk of their applications being limited to just the Flux network.</p>\n<p>Flux has launched several parallel assets on other blockchains, including Flux-Kadena, Flux-ETH, and Flux-BSC on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. In Q3 2021, Flux-Sol and Flux-Tron were also distributed. Flux-Avax was the first asset to be released in 2022, followed by the Flux-Ergo launch in the fall. There will be a total of ten parallel assets, seven of which have been deployed with three still to come.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flux-ecosystem\">Flux Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>As stated earlier, the Flux ecosystem is home to more than 4000 projects. Given the network’s ease of access and reliability, it is likely to see more adoption in the future. Here’s a list of the main components of the Flux ecosystem presently. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://runonflux.io/fluxos.html\">FluxOS</a></strong>: FluxOS is an advanced second-layer operating system/application that allows developers to deploy hardened, dockerized apps on Flux&#39;s fully decentralized computational network. It also allows for the creation of parallel assets, which can be used to interact with other blockchains and access decentralized finance services.</li>\n<li><strong>$FLUX</strong>: This is the native digital currency of the Flux ecosystem, which can be mined using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://runonflux.io/flux.html\">The Flux blockchain</a></strong>: is the foundation of the Flux ecosystem and is responsible for maintaining and verifying all transactions, smart contracts, and other data stored on the network. It also plays a vital role in the governance, economics, and parallel assets of the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://zelcore.io/\">Zelcor</a><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">e</span></strong>: This is the primary digital asset platform in the Flux ecosystem. It includes a wallet called the Zelcore wallet and a built-in trading tool. Users can easily manage and trade their digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokens, and other digital assets, on various exchanges through its user-friendly interface. Zelcore supports a wide range of digital assets and provides advanced security features alongside several useful functions.</li>\n<li><strong>The Flux Network (<a href=\"https://runonflux.io/flux-nodes.html\">FluxNodes</a></strong>): A decentralized network for powering and running DApps on the Flux ecosystem. It uses a global network of nodes for live and operational DApps at all times, ensuring scalability and security. Network participants can interact with global apps, vote in the Flux network DAO and view resources and rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"flux-tokenomics\">FLUX Tokenomics</h2>\n<p>The total FLUX supply is 440 million units of which 94.7% is owned by users, and 2.9% is held by the Flux Foundation. The remaining 1.7% is allocated for exchange listing and liquidity, and 0.7% is held by the Flux team. The circulating supply is 257,367,586 FLUX; 106,254,000 FLUX of which is locked in Flux nodes.</p>\n<p>There was no ICO/IEO/Pre-sale held for FLUX and the block reward for mining is split evenly between Proof of Work (POW) mining and FluxNode operators. The current reward rests at 37.5 FLUX per block. Node operators also receive rewards through a deterministic round-robin system, ensuring fair distribution. Additional rewards can be earned through parallel mining of Flux parallel assets, which doubles the block rewards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-flux-flux\">How to Mine Flux (FLUX)</h2>\n<p>Since its inception Flux has been <a href=\"https://runonflux.io/mining.html\">GPU mined</a>. This is a crypto mining process that uses specialized graphics card cores to solve crypto puzzles and verify transaction blocks. FLUX can be mined on Fluxpools.net, which is the community pool, or on a variety of third-party pools that support the mining ecosystem. It&#39;s worth noting that there are pools that allow you to mine Flux parallel assets, which offer higher rewards.</p>\n<p>In addition to traditional mining, there are other ways to earn FLUX within the Flux community. One way is to participate in the Flux Discord, where community members can earn FLUX through a variety of activities such as bug reporting and contributing to the development of the ecosystem. Users can also gain FLUX at first just by holding, as every time FLUX introduces a new parallel asset there is an airdrop of the new tokens to FLUX holders. Another viable option is to buy FLUX in a crypto exchange service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flux-value-data\">FLUX Value Data</h2>\n<p>As of January 28, 2023 the FLUX coin price rests at $0.900454, roughly 42% above its 52-week low. Following its inception, FLUX traded at an average of $0.03 until late 2021 when its value began to climb. The token hit an all-time high of $4.17 in December of that year. This came amid the 2021 DeFi boom as FLUX saw an upward trend in demand for its features across the cryptocurrency market. The current circulating supply of FLUX is 288,319,894 coins and a max supply of 440,000,000 coins.  The FLUX market cap is $260M, and the token is ranked 131st on CoinMarketCap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Flux_to_USD_3df70e4226.png\" alt=\"Flux to USD\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"flux-flux-2023-price-prediction\">Flux (FLUX) 2023 Price Prediction</h2>\n<p>FLUX has continued to trade steadily over the past year despite the volatile conditions of the crypto market.

Even as a newbie in the blockchain space, chances are you’ve heard about the Solana ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The network touts itself as the most performant permissionless blockchain globally, but with the crypto industry’s growth, it can be hard to keep up with all the new developments. Let’s explore Solana’s ins and outs and its evolution from its inception in 2017 up to 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-solana\">What is Solana?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-solana-blockchain\">Introducing the Solana Blockchain</h3>\n<p><strong>Solana</strong> is a blockchain platform that is designed to host decentralized and scalable applications. It is an open-source network, which means that developers can build and launch their own decentralized applications using it. Solana initially emerged as a rival to the Ethereum (<a href=\"link\">ETH</a>) blockchain. Like the latter, it offers smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s other core features include its high speed, with the potential to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, and low transaction costs averaging at $0.00025. Transaction fees on Solana are in the network’s native token, <a href=\"link\">SOL</a>.</p>\n<p>The Solana coin is a utility token that functions as a medium of exchange and helps prop up security on the platform via staking. The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former executive at Qualcomm, in 2017 and is currently run by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-solana\">A brief history of Solana</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-and-why-solana-was-created\">How and why Solana was created</h3>\n<p>Solana emerged in response to the scalability limitations of existing blockchain platforms such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BTC</a>) and Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Bitcoin price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believed that agreement on time was one of the biggest challenges of a distributed model.</p>\n<p>Yakovenko recognized that a reliable and accurate clock was crucial for network synchronization. As such, he began working on and developed the concept of <a href=\"link\">proof of history</a>. This technique allows for keeping time between untrusted computers, making network synchronization simpler and faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-exactly-is-solanas-proof-of-history\">What exactly is Solana’s proof of history?</h3>\n<p>The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism is Solana’s chosen technique to keep the time between computers that do not trust each other. The basic idea behind PoH is to use a &quot;timestamp&quot; that is generated by a central server and broadcast to all nodes on the network. This timestamp serves as a reference point for the network, allowing all nodes to agree on the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_26_18_PM_b5d4d80061.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.26.18 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"link\">Medium</a> </p>\n<p>To generate the timestamp, the central server creates a &quot;hash&quot; of a large amount of data (known as a &quot;PoH generator&quot;) and publishes it to the network. Each node on the network can then use this hash to verify the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p>The PoH generator is designed to be computationally expensive to create, ensuring it can only be generated by a central server and not by any individual node on the network. This helps to prevent any one node from manipulating the timestamp or the sequence of events.</p>\n<p>By using the PoH mechanism, Solana can achieve high levels of network synchronization and scalability, allowing it to process a large number of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement over other blockchain systems that lack a reliable clock and struggle to scale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-journey-to-the-solana-launch-yakovenkos-path\">The journey to the Solana launch: Yakovenko’s path</h3>\n<p>Solana was technically created in November 2017 when Anatoly Yakovenko published the whitepaper for the proof-of-history concept. This technique would serve as the foundation for the Solana project. With plans to weave all the world&#39;s transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called it Loom.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald <a href=\"link\">published</a> the first open-source implementation of the PoH technique on GitHub under the name Silk. The project quickly gained traction, and the team continued to develop it.</p>\n<p>By March 2018, the team rebranded the project as Solana, a nod to the small beach town where Yakovenko and his team lived and worked. In June of that same year, they had scaled the technology to run on cloud-based networks. The next month, they published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>After months of testing and development, the Solana mainnet went live on March 31, 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-price-evolution\">Solana price evolution</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-is-solana-worth\">How much is Solana worth?</h3>\n<p>Solana’s SOL token, like most cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price fluctuations. In the first few months after the launch, the Solana price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1.00.</p>\n<p>However, in late 2020, the price of Solana began to rise rapidly. Driven by the non-fungible token (NFT) hype and the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. SOL more than tripled to a peak of $18.00 in early 2021. Solana reached its all-time high of $258 in November 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_40_45_PM_ff2553a118.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.40.45 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Solana price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these gains were nearly wiped out by the end of last year due to the crypto crash and subsequent contagion. Solana’s price took a hard hit from FTX’s implosion due to its close association with the exchange and subsidiaries. SOL dropped under $10 in late December for the first time since February 2021. However, it has recovered in the past month to trade at $24.22 currently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-solana-coins-are-there\">How many Solana coins are there?</h3>\n<p>The Solana foundation revealed that the total number of Solana (SOL) coins to enter circulation is 489 million. At the moment, 260 million tokens are available on the market. </p>\n<h3 id=\"where-can-you-buy-solana\">Where can you buy Solana?</h3>\n<p>Solana (SOL) can be purchased on a variety of exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and <a href=\"link\">ChangeNow</a>. With a user-friendly interface and a wide variety of payment options, ChangeNow makes it easy for anyone to purchase SOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanas-major-developments\">Solana’s major developments</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2019\">Solana’s 2019</h3>\n<p>Right before the Solana mainnet launch, much of the team’s attention was on obtaining funding to develop its new crypto network. The project had already begun to gain traction.</p>\n<p>As such, the team was able to raise $20 million in a private token sale led by Multicoin Capital in Q1 2019. Other participants were Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2020\">Solana’s 2020</h3>\n<p>The year 2020 marked Solana’s emergence as the first blockchain to use proof of history. The platform launched on Mainnet Beta in March 2020, following successful fundraising and the launch of their public test network, Tour de SOL.</p>\n<p>That same year, <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href=\"link\">USDT</a>) launched Solana-native <strong>USDT</strong> and Circle partnered to make <strong><a href=\"link\">USDC</a></strong> a native stablecoin on the platform. Solana also held its first hackathon from October 28 to November 14.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Tether price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2021\">Solana’s 2021</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s 2020 hackathon and subsequent ones were a success, leading to an influx of developers and projects onto the platform. By December 2021, Solana had exceeded 1,000 projects and saw a significant rise in its price and daily active users. This propelled the SOL token to the fifth spot on the crypto list, surpassing <strong>Cardano</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<p>However, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for 17 hours. The platform had formerly gone down for 6 hours in December 2021, earning it a reputation for frequent outages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Cardano price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2022\">Solana’s 2022</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s outage problem persisted into 2022. Despite this, the network was able to make some progress. Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, announced integration with Ethereum and Polygon. In June, Solana revealed plans for the first crypto smartphone, the Solana Saga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/solana_saga_01_7aaaabbbc6.jpg\" alt=\"solana-saga_01.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>The platform also opened a physical store in New York City dedicated to all things crypto in July. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Solana_just_launched_a_physical_store_in_metaverse_79dcec4278.jpg\" alt=\"Solana-just-launched-a-physical-store-in-metaverse.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>Notably, Solana&#39;s NFT market experienced substantial growth in 2022, with the number of minted NFTs reaching 312,000 on September 7. Additionally, Solana NFT trading volumes rose to hit $11.5 million on September 6.</p>\n<p>However, in August, the platform&#39;s mobile wallet suffered a hack resulting in $8 million worth of losses. Thousands of Solana users suffered in the attack, which Solana ultimately blamed on a third-party platform, the Slope mobile wallet app. Solana experienced more losses later on as the FTX and Alameda saga caused the single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics as SOL dipped 96%. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solana-ecosystem\">The Solana ecosystem</h3>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem is home to a diverse range of projects, from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The platform’s speed, affordability, and scalability mean it is quickly becoming a go-to destination for developers, entrepreneurs, and users who want to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications and services. </p>\n<p>Among these projects are <strong>Phantom</strong>, a decentralized social network that empowers users to share content, earn rewards, and connect with others; <strong>Stepn</strong> (<a href=\"link\">GMT</a>), a platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows artists and creators to monetize their work. Solana also hosts <strong>Star Atlas</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ATLAS</a>), a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading digital assets, and <strong>Audius</strong>, initially built on Ethereum but moved to Solana in 2020, a decentralized streaming platform for musicians that enables them to control their music and earn royalties directly from fans.</p>\n<p>More recently, <strong>BONK</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BONK</a>),  “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people,” which was released in December 2020. </p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Like most other projects in the crypto industry, Solana reaped the benefits of 2021’s DeFi and NFT boom. In the same vein, it was unable to escape the impact of the crypto winter in 2022. Still, its attractive blend of speed and affordability, thanks to its unique technology, makes it a staple for most developers in this space. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest SOL trading pairs <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Also Read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/analyst-predicts-sols-price-prior-to-solanas-milestone-conference\">Analyst Predicts SOL’s Price Prior to Solana’s Conference</a></li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-26T19:28:00.275Z","createdAt":"2023-01-26T18:47:45.949Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-02T10:18:16.163Z"},{"id":1373,"title":"Litecoin vs Ripple: Differences, and Everything You Need to Know","description":"Since their creation, LTC and XRP have gained traction and prominence as top cryptocurrencies.

Charlie Lee launched Litecoin in 2011, while the team of David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto created Ripple in 2012. These two tokens have stamped their foot firmly on crypto soil and this is because of their use cases. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_12_Litecoin_vs_Ripple_4d93edbfdc.png\" alt=\"Litecoin vs Ripple\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"litecoin\">Litecoin</h2>\n<p>Litecoin enables fast and secure payments at a low cost. It was created based on Bitcoin’s protocol but aims to improve Bitcoin’s qualities. For instance, while bitcoin transactions take 1 to 1.5 hours to complete, Litecoin slashes the time by 87-97% with a transaction time of 2 to 8 minutes. Its transaction time—coupled with its low transaction fees—makes it appropriate for micro-transactions and point-of-sale (POS) payments.</p>\n<p>Litecoin serves different purposes for individuals and businesses. Individuals can store their Litecoin in various crypto storage platforms such as digital wallets, hardware wallets, and online crypto banks. By storing them on any of these platforms, the user can manage and carry out Litecoin transactions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Litecoin enables businesses to carry out speedy and low-cost crypto transactions without intermediaries or third parties. Because of Litecoin’s fast and secure network, several businesses trade billions of dollars daily. These businesses integrate Litecoin into their payment gateways and point-of-sale terminals.   </p>\n<h2 id=\"ripple\">Ripple</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/ripple-coin-review\">Ripple</a>, on the other hand, operates on its own decentralized, open-source blockchain known as XRP Ledger. The XRP Ledger is a decentralized exchange that supports cross-currency payments, micropayment gateways, multi-signing for custody and security, and other tokens that are not XRP.    </p>\n<p>Like Litecoin, Ripple also enables speedy and low-cost transactions. (Ripple transactions are usually completed within 3 to 5 seconds.) In addition to these qualities, the XRP Ledger makes XRP highly scalable (processes 1,500 per second) and energy efficient. Currently, developers in the XRP community are building smart contracts, NFT ecosystems, and sidechains.  </p>\n<h1 id=\"how-do-they-work\">How Do They Work</h1>\n<h2 id=\"litecoin-1\">Litecoin</h2>\n<p>Since Litecoin is based on Bitcoin’s protocol, it also uses the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus and undergoes halving events similar to Bitcoin’s. Litecoin miners’ rewards are reduced by half every four years. The last halving event took place in August 2019 and ushered in a mining reward of 12.5 LTC. At the next halving event in August 2023, miners will begin to receive 6.25 LTC. (Bitcoin’s last halving happened in May 2020, with miners receiving a reward of 6.25 BTC. The next halving will be in May 2024 and miners will begin to receive 3.125 BTC.)</p>\n<p>Though Litecoin and Bitcoin share some similarities, there are differences between the two. For instance, they differ in their hashing algorithms, that is, the way they store data. Litecoin uses Scrypt; Bitcoin uses SHA-256. </p>\n<h2 id=\"ripple-1\">Ripple</h2>\n<p>The XRP Ledger uses a consensus mechanism known as the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA). This consensus does not make use of miners but bank-owned computers for confirming transactions.</p>\n<p>The XRP Ledger also hosts several payment-related applications that offer use cases such as micropayments, DeFi payments, and NFT payments. Furthermore, the Ledger allows developers to build in different languages including Python, Java, and JavaScript. These applications are highly flexible and come with robust utilities. They are grouped into five classes: payments, stablecoins, tokenization, DeFi, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-are-the-numbers\">What Are the Numbers?</h1>\n<p>Litecoin and Ripple occupy strong positions in the crypto space.

Cryptocurrency has gained significant popularity in recent years as a decentralized, digital form of currency. However, without proper security measures in place, individuals risk losing their hard-earned digital assets to hackers and cybercriminals. Therefore, it is essential to understand and implement best practices for securing cryptocurrency to protect against potential threats. Below are a few ways to keep your crypto secure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_10_how_to_keep_your_crypto_secure_e5b6f96415.png\" alt=\"how to keep your crypto secure\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"use-a-hardware-wallet\"><strong>Use a hardware wallet</strong></h2>\n<p>A hardware wallet is a physical device that is designed to securely store cryptocurrencies. These wallets are considered to be one of the safest options for storing crypto, as they provide an extra layer of protection against hacking and other security threats.</p>\n<p>Using a hardware wallet is relatively simple. It&#39;s important to note that a hardware wallet is only as secure as you make it. First, you need to purchase a hardware wallet from a reputable manufacturer. Next, you will need to set up the wallet by following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. This typically involves creating a passphrase and writing it down in a secure location.</p>\n<p>Once your hardware wallet is set up, you can start using it to store your crypto. To do this, you will need to connect the wallet to your computer or mobile device using a USB cable. From there, you can transfer your crypto to the wallet using your preferred crypto wallet or exchange.</p>\n<p>Make sure to follow best practices for keeping your hardware wallet and passphrase safe, such as not sharing your passphrase with anyone and keeping the wallet in a secure location.</p>\n<p>Overall, using a hardware wallet is a great way to keep your crypto safe and secure. Whether you&#39;re a seasoned crypto investor or new to the world of cryptocurrencies, a hardware wallet is a valuable tool that can help you protect your assets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enable-two-factor-authentication\"><strong>Enable two-factor authentication</strong></h2>\n<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an important security measure that can help protect your accounts and assets. 2FA adds a layer of protection by requiring a second form of authentication beyond just your password. This can help prevent unauthorized access to your accounts, even if your password is compromised.</p>\n<p>There are several different types of 2FA that can be used to secure your cryptocurrency accounts. One common type is SMS-based 2FA, which involves sending a code to your phone via text message. Another option is app-based 2FA, which uses a dedicated smartphone app to generate codes. There are also hardware-based options, such as security keys, which are physical devices that you can use to authenticate your login.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the specific type of 2FA you use, the process is generally the same. When you log in to your cryptocurrency account, you will be prompted to enter a code that has been sent to your phone or generated by your 2FA app or hardware device. This code must be entered in addition to your password in order to gain access to your account.</p>\n<p>Using 2FA can help protect your cryptocurrency accounts and assets from being accessed by unauthorized parties. It&#39;s a simple, effective way to add an extra layer of security to your online accounts and is highly recommended for anyone holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency.</p>\n<h2 id=\"always-use-a-secure-exchange-for-transactions\"><strong>Always Use a Secure Exchange for Transactions</strong></h2>\n<p>Using a secure exchange is an important step in keeping your crypto assets safe. One option is to use a non-custodial exchange such as ChangeNOW. Using a non-custodial exchange means you are not at risk of losing your assets to a hack or a financial crisis. ChangeNOW is a popular choice for anonymous exchanges, offering a user-friendly platform and a wide range of crypto assets to choose from. Remember to always do your own research and due diligence before choosing an exchange, and make sure to use strong and unique passwords for all of your accounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-strong-unique-passwords\"><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords</strong></h2>\n<p>Using strong, unique passwords is an essential security measure for protecting your cryptocurrency accounts and assets. A strong password is one that is difficult for others to guess or crack, while a unique password is one that you don&#39;t use for any other accounts.</p>\n<p>There are a few key things to keep in mind when creating strong, unique passwords for your cryptocurrency accounts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess or crack your password.</li>\n<li>Make your password at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are generally more secure, as they are more difficult to crack.</li>\n<li>Avoid using common words or phrases as passwords. Instead, use a combination of unrelated words or a passphrase.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t reuse passwords across multiple accounts. If one account is compromised, this could potentially give an attacker access to all of your accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By following these tips, you can help ensure that your cryptocurrency accounts and assets are as secure as possible. It may take a little extra effort to create and remember strong, unique passwords, but the added security is well worth it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"secure-your-device-and-practice-good-security-habits\"><strong>Secure your Device and Practice Good Security Habits</strong></h2>\n<p>Aside from the recommended choice of cold wallets and other measures, it is also wise to practice good security habits. Here are some steps you can take to ensure the safety of your digital assets:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep your device&#39;s operating system and security software up to date. Cybercriminals often exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to gain access to devices and accounts.</li>\n<li>Be careful when clicking on links or downloading attachments, as they may contain malware that can compromise your device and steal your cryptocurrency.</li>\n<li>Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive transactions, as they may not be secure. If you need to use public Wi-Fi, consider using a <a href=\"https://cybernews.com/best-vpn/vpn-for-iphone/\">virtual private network (VPN) on your mobile device</a> or computer to encrypt your internet connection.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t share your private keys or recovery phrases with anyone, as these give access to your cryptocurrency. Store them in a safe and secure location, such as a hardware wallet or a physical document that is stored securely.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"final-words\"><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>\n<p>In conclusion, keeping your Crypto safe requires a combination of best practices and choosing the right tools. This includes using strong and unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and storing your assets in a secure wallet. It&#39;s also important to choose a trusted and secure exchange to handle your transactions. By following these guidelines and staying vigilant, you can protect your Crypto and enjoy the benefits of this exciting technology with peace of mind.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-11T15:37:50.036Z","createdAt":"2023-01-11T15:37:43.415Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-15T14:28:57.687Z"},{"id":1368,"title":"Jasmy Coin Price Prediction - 2023, 2025, 2030 Jasmy Forecast | ChangeNOW","description":"Will JasmyCoin Price recover after its drop in 2022?

But the past swings can give context. </p>\n<p>JasmyCoin was launched on February 12th, 2021 at a price of $1.3 and started trading at an all-time high price of $4.99 on February, 16th, 2021, a surge of almost 300%. Since then, the JasmyCoin price has been highly volatile and JasmyCoin fell more than 64% within a week from its all-time high to a price of $1.77. For the next few months, Jasmy traded between the price of $1 and $2 before losing the support price of $1 and falling below it. </p>\n<p>In July 2021, the price of JasmyCoin fell to $0.010 and has been taken over by market bears since then. When the crypto markets peaked during the last quarter of 2021, the Jasmy token price jumped more than 1000% and reached $0.27 due to it being listed on Coinbase. </p>\n<p>The JasmyCoin price tumbled along with the entire crypto market in June 2022.

Hence, the long-term forecast for the Jasmy price is towards the upside. </p>\n<p>Looking at the past support levels, accumulation zones, etc., Jasmy does not need to go through a lot of resistance levels to reach $1 and beyond in the future. This presents the investors with some of the best buying opportunities for JasmyCoin. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jasmy-coin-price-prediction-2023\"><a name=jasmy-coin-price-prediction-2023></a>Jasmy Coin Price Prediction 2023</h2>\n<p>The global economy and the crypto market prediction for the short term is to be in a bear market phase.

The prediction for Jasmy in 2025 is to make an upward move and reach a maximum of $0.020 and with a lower range between $0.017 and $0.018 in 2025. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jasmy-coin-price-prediction-2030\"><a name=jasmy-coin-price-prediction-2030></a>Jasmy Coin Price Prediction 2030</h2>\n<p>Making long-term predictions for assets across any sector is hard and especially for assets as volatile as cryptocurrencies. But the outlook for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is positive in the long run as real-world mass adoption occurs and there is more clarity about their legal status. Hence, a conservative prediction of the price of Jasmy for 2030 is a maximum of $0.03200, with the price of JasmyCoin ranging from $0.025 and $0.027. </p>\n<p>_Disclaimer: The contents of this article should not be considered a piece of financial advice and are only meant for educational purposes.

That is expected to pump JasmyCoin to a maximum price of $0.032 and the price of JasmyCoin will range between $0.025 and $0.027.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-jasmy-coin-safe\"><a name=is-jasmy-coin-safe></a>Is Jasmy Coin Safe?</h3>\n<p>Given the state of the crypto industry right now with the collapse of LUNA and FTX recently, no crypto project is 100% safe. But since JasmyCoin is the first legal crypto according to the Japanese Financial Services Agency, Jasmy can be considered relatively safer than a lot of projects out there. </p>\n<h3 id=\"can-jasmy-reach-1\"><a name=can-jasmy-reach-$1></a>Can Jasmy Reach $1?</h3>\n<p>The outlook for JasmyCoin is very positive as it combines two of the most important technologies, namely, the Internet of Things and blockchain together. Hence, once mass adoption picks up pace, there is a very high chance that JasmyCoin will again start trading at $1 and above. </p>\n<h3 id=\"can-jasmy-reach-100\"><a name=can-jasmy-reach-$100></a>Can Jasmy Reach $100?</h3>\n<p>The total supply of JasmyCoin is 50 billion tokens and for the price to reach $100 for one JasmyCoin, the market cap of Jasmy will have to go into trillions. Hence, it is highly unlikely that Jasmy would ever hit the price of $100 per token. </p>\n<h3 id=\"how-high-can-jasmy-reach\"><a name=how-high-can-jasmy-reach></a>How High Can Jasmy Reach?</h3>\n<p>JasmyCoin is near its all-time low price right now, so it presents a great buying opportunity as the price of JasmyCoin can definitely do anywhere between 10x to 10000x easily. If JasmyCoin does 10000x from its current price, Jasmy can reach a price of $30 per token. </p>\n<h3 id=\"when-was-jasmy-all-time-high\"><a name=when-was-jasmy-all-time-high></a>When Was Jasmy All-Time High?</h3>\n<p>JasmyCoin was launched in February 2021 and within a couple of days, JasmyCoin reached its all-time high price of $4.99 on February 16th, 2021. Since then the price of JasmyCoin is down by nearly 99 percent and trading near all-time lows, therefore providing a wonderful buying opportunity.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-10T15:31:57.974Z","createdAt":"2022-12-29T18:47:29.896Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-13T15:44:10.596Z"},{"id":1371,"title":"Coins That Failed in 2022","description":"Many crypto tokens have made smashing debuts promising the moon to prospective users.

With the leading names hanging by a thread other altcoins were not spared in the bloodbaths. Stablecoins took some of the market’s biggest blows. Also, as the metaverse hype began to die down, so did some tokens with ties to the sector.</p>\n<p>In November 2020, the crypto market embarked on a bull run that saw up to 8000 tokens flood the space within the next 12 months. However, per a report from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, 3,322 tokens that were listed on the platform a year ago failed to stand the test of time.  Indeed, roughly 41% of the tokens listed in 2021 have now been deactivated on the aggregator. Let’s take a look at some of these coins and what exactly caused them to go six feet under.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_09_Coins_that_Failed_in_2022_2e7442150e.png\" alt=\"Coins that Failed in 2022\" ></p>\n<p><strong>1. Terra Classic (LUNC)</strong></p>\n<p>One of the crypto space&#39;s biggest disasters is the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. In May of 2022, the network’s governance token <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/terra-classic\">LUNC</a> formerly tagged LUNA, took a nosedive, plummeting about 80%, making it near worthless. It&#39;s still unclear what caused the crash, but some suspect it was a targeted attack on the token and the network. Talk about a crypto sob story!</p>\n<p><strong>2.  Terra Stablecoin (USTC)</strong></p>\n<p>Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST was hot on LUNA’s tails as it collapsed, losing its peg to the dollar. The reason for this was that UST’s stablecoin model meant the token was backed by LUNA rather than a real-world asset. Terra used a unique algorithm to ensure 1 UST remained equal to $1, however, in roughly 48 hours the token tanked, clocking as low as $0.26.</p>\n<p><strong>3. FTX token (FTT)</strong></p>\n<p>Making perhaps an even bigger mess than Terra did, Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire imploded in early November. As FTX’s dirty secrets spilled out the exchange went down taking its native token to the grave with it. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ftx-token\">FTT</a> dropped from $22 to under $5 in one day wiping a whopping $2B from the market. It has dropped even lower since then, resting at $0.84 as users shy away from all things FTX.</p>\n<p><strong>4. DEI (DEI)</strong></p>\n<p>As waves from Terra’s downfall rippled outwards, DEUS Finance’s algorithmic stablecoin DEI was unable to avoid being swept along. The token lost its dollar peg amid the FTX melee and continued falling, hitting a record low of $0.1086 3 months ago.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Acala Dollar (AUSD)</strong></p>\n<p>For Acala Network it was a common story, the platform had a bug. The twist to this tale is that a malicious actor exploited the opening to mint over 1.28B tokens out of thin air. The network’s native stablecoin, AUSD dropped as low as $0.009 and has struggled to recover since.</p>\n<p><strong>6. GALA (GALA)</strong></p>\n<p>The downfall of Gala Games’ <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/gala-erc20\">GALA</a> token began with a misconfiguration of the pNetwork bridge that led to the release of extra GALA GAME tokens. A dramatic drop in the token’s value followed prompting rumors of a rug pull. GALA lost 90% of its price and faced a series of exchange delistings that further worsened the situation. </p>\n<p><strong>7. Axie Infinity (AXS)</strong></p>\n<p>Its status as one of the industry’s biggest metaverse projects did not shield the play-to-earn (P2E) game Axie Infinity from the effects of the bear market. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/axie-infinity\">AXS</a> saw its market cap shed over $200M in under a month with the token’s price following suit. The price dump came as the Axie team shared plans to release 21.5 Million AXS tokens in what some tagged a suicide mission. </p>\n<p><strong>8. The Sandbox (SAND)</strong></p>\n<p>The Sandbox (<a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/the-sandbox\">SAND</a>) token has had a rocky ride owing to the recent collapse of the FTX exchange. The token has experienced some price fluctuations in the past and has struggled to maintain consistent growth in the face of market conditions. Data from the past few months shows a sharp decline in the price of SAND, and it seems that the bearish trend may continue at least in the near future.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Neutrino USD (USDN)</strong></p>\n<p>Neutrino USD (USDN), a stablecoin of the Waves ecosystem, has continued to keep investors on the edge of their seats as they hope the token will not end up like Terra’s UST. Outside of a brief stint in October where it managed to hold on to its peg, USDN has built a history of instability, failing in its very purpose as a stablecoin. </p>\n<h2 id=\"why-some-tokens-fail-dead-giveaways-for-dead-coins\">Why Some Tokens Fail; Dead Giveaways for Dead Coins</h2>\n<p>Crypto token failure can come from a variety of sources - scams, fraud, poor management, and even exploits as shown in some of the tokens listed above. However, the general turbulence of the crypto space in the last couple of months played a huge part in the crypto decline. Indeed, the Terra crash dealt a major blow to investor faith in stablecoins, and the pertinent asset class suffered as a result. As an investor, it&#39;s crucial to do your research and understand the risks before diving in. After all, it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry (or broke).</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-10T11:38:11.409Z","createdAt":"2023-01-10T11:37:51.859Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-10T11:38:11.426Z"},{"id":1369,"title":"Weekly Wrap: Japan to Reverse Ban on Foreign Stablecoins","description":"Due to new regulations, Japan may welcome stablecoins like Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC) in 2023.

Having installed 216 ATMs as of the beginning of 2023, Australia has taken the lead from the central American nation.</p>\n<p>In 2021, El Salvador made headlines as the first country to legally recognize Bitcoin as a form of tender. To further drive BTC adoption, crypto-enthusiastic President Nayib Bukele spearheaded the installation of over 200 crypto ATMs across the nation. The move saw the country become the world’s third-largest crypto ATM hub, however, this was only a short-lived status for El Salvador.</p>\n<p>In October 2022, with 215 installations Spain pushed past El Salvador to become the third-largest hub for crypto ATMs. But the country didn&#39;t stop there, Spain installed a further 11 ATMs in the following months, bringing the total to 226. El Salvador of course had fallen to fourth place, but once more, the country was only there for a short time. </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://coinatmradar.com/charts/net-growth/australia/\">data</a> from CoinATMRadar, Australia deployed 99 BTC crypto ATMs in the final quarter of 2022 alone. As of January 1st, 2023, Australia had 219 active crypto ATMs, surpassing El Salvador&#39;s count by seven. Australia represents 0.6% of global crypto ATM installations and the country is on track to overtake Asia, which currently has 312 ATMs.</p>\n<p>There are currently 38,602 crypto ATMs in operation worldwide, with a staggering 6,071 being installed in just the past year. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/weekly_recap_01_deeef9fd00.png\" alt=\"weekly recap 01.png\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"sbf-denies-transferring-funds-from-alameda-wallets\">SBF Denies Transferring Funds From Alameda Wallets</h2>\n<p>Per a Twitter report, ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried may have cashed out large sums of crypto shortly after his $250M release on bail. DeFi analyst BowTiedIguana made the allegations in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BowTiedIguana/status/1608653434387050496?s=20&amp;t=eNwE_OsNrxxTM7zExlniPw\">tweet</a> on Thursday, citing on-chain data to back up their claims.</p>\n<p>The report claimed that SBF had withdrawn $684,000 in crypto to a centralized exchange in Seychelles while under house arrest. Such a move would mean SBF had violated the release conditions that limit him to spending no more than $1,000 without permission from the court. However, according to BowTiedIguana’s analysis, SBF’s public address (0xD5758) on Dec. 28 sent all remaining Ether to a newly created address (0x7386d).</p>\n<p>Later that day, 32 addresses with ties to Alameda research moved $367,000 in crypto to that same wallet. The wallet later received an additional $322,000 from various other wallets, bringing the total to approximately $689,000. Subsequently, the address 0x7386d transferred the assets to the aforementioned Seychelles-based exchange and the crypto bridge RenBridge, said the analyst.</p>\n<p>SBF denied the rumors in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1608908562851598336?s=20&amp;t=uEW6dAvNtsafnA94U6dsbA\">tweet</a> on Friday where he shared that none of the transactions could have been him. According to his post, the disgraced FTX founder no longer has access to any of the assets in question. </p>\n<h2 id=\"russias-top-bank-issues-its-first-ever-gold-backed-digital-financial-assets\">Russia&#39;s Top Bank Issues its First Ever Gold-backed Digital Financial Assets</h2>\n<p>Russia&#39;s largest bank, Sber, has announced the issuance of gold-backed digital financial assets (DFAs). News of the move emerged via a Dec 26 <a href=\"http://www.sberbank.ru/en/press_center/all/article?newsID=b49bd8f3-50ec-46b3-a84e-c6d4bbff7467&amp;blockID=1539&amp;regionID=77&amp;lang=en&amp;type=NEWS\">publication</a> from the bank. The release described the gold-backed assets as DFAs certifying monetary rights, whose price and volume depend on gold prices.</p>\n<p>Per the report, Solfer, a diversified metals seller and manufacturer, was the first investor to obtain the assets. Maxim Nazhmetdinov, CEO, Solfer explained the company’s motivation to acquire DFAs.</p>\n<p>“Working with precious and non-precious metals, we got excited about the new digital gold format and decided to try out this new method to diversify the company’s balance sheet,” Nazhmetdinov said, “The deal was closed fast. We think this new vehicle facilitating precious metals investments may carve out a market niche.”</p>\n<p>Alexander Vedyakhin, first deputy chairman of the Executive Board, Sberbank also commented on the purchase and DFAs in general. According to him, DFAs are another option for traditional investments amid the “de-dollarization” brought on by international sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n<p><em>“The deal demonstrates that the market and the real economy are interested in the new instrument, which may be a great alternative to investments amid de-dollarization,”</em> Vedyakhin said.</p>\n<p>He went on to state the bank’s expectations following the issuance which include a rise in corporate clients. As such Sber intends to expand the product line of digital financial assets. To make these assets available to potential investors, Sber has announced that it will offer a maximum of 150,000 DFAs for purchase. This offer will last until July 30, 2023. </p>\n<h2 id=\"japan-to-lift-restrictions-on-foreign-issued-stablecoins-in-2023\">Japan to Lift Restrictions on Foreign Issued Stablecoins in 2023</h2>\n<p>The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has unveiled new regulations that will permit local exchanges to engage in stablecoin trading. </p>\n<p>In June 2022, Japan&#39;s parliament passed a bill banning non-banking institutions from issuing stablecoins. However, as <a href=\"https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB23DU80T21C22A2000000/\">reported</a> by Nikkei on December 26th, the FSA is set to lift the ban on the domestic distribution of these coins if they meet certain conditions. The requirements in question include asset preservation by deposits as well as a cap on remittance.</p>\n<p>The nation’s new introduction of these regulations will have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency trading services available in Japan. This is because no local exchanges currently offer trading in stablecoins like USDT or USDC. None of the 31 registered Japanese exchanges, including BitFlyer and Coincheck, were trading stablecoins as of November 30, 2022, according to official data.</p>\n<p>The FSA expects that the move will accelerate and reduce the cost of international money transfers if stablecoin usage becomes more widespread. However, to ensure compliance with Anti-Money Laundering controls, the agency will also implement stricter regulations.

According to the release, Binance.US made the best proposition to acquire the bankrupt platform’s holdings. </p>\n<p>Voyager stated in its release that the Binance.US bid had emerged as the best path for its customers. The broker claimed to have carefully considered bids from other key industry players such as CrossTower, Wave Financial, and INX. However, Voyager aims to maximize the value ex-customers and creditors will receive while simultaneously speeding up the refund process. </p>\n<p>The Binance bid reportedly “sets a clear path forward for Voyager customer funds to be unlocked as soon as possible.” Binance will pay a total of $1.022B which covers the fair market value of Voyager’s crypto portfolio, worth about $1.002B at writing. The additional $20 million is to account for a possible increase in the future. </p>\n<p>Per the release, Voyager’s claims against Three Arrows Capital will remain with the bankruptcy estate. The announcement noted that the estate&#39;s creditors will receive any future proceeds from the 3AC claims and any unreleased claims.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Binance and Voyager are to finalize the agreement before April 18 next year. For now, the exchange will make a $10M good faith deposit and will also refund the Voyager for expenses worth $15M. </p>\n<h2 id=\"brazil-legalizes-crypto-as-a-payment-option\">Brazil Legalizes Crypto as a Payment Option</h2>\n<p>On Thursday morning, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro signed a bill allowing the country’s residents to transact using cryptocurrency. Brazil now supports digital assets such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a legitimate payment method. Under the new policy, Brazil also has a robust regulatory structure for the crypto industry within its borders. \nDubbed bill 14.478, the newly approved law was in existence for 7 years in discussion within congress. It finally passed through the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate last month, hitting the President’s table on November 29. Bolsonaro then gave the final go-ahead for the bill with zero alterations. </p>\n<p>As stated earlier the bill creates a regulatory framework for crypto businesses. Exchange platforms and other intermediaries in Brazil are now required to apply for a &quot;virtual service provider&quot; license. The bill also spells out penalties for crypto-related crimes which include fines and jail time of 4–6 years.</p>\n<p>Brazil’s new crypto policy did not reveal which government agencies will have jurisdiction over crypto activities. However, the nation’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) will take charge of crypto assets that can be considered securities. </p>\n<h2 id=\"paxos-retrieves-20m-in-paxg-from-ftx-hack-in-november\">Paxos Retrieves $20M in PAXG From FTX Hack in November</h2>\n<p>During the week, Blockchain company Paxos recovered $20M worth of its PAXG tokens which got lost over November’s <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/weekly-recap-exchanges-publish-transparent-records-after-ftx-crash\">FTX exploit</a>. Indeed, early last month shortly after its spectacular collapse, failed crypto exchange FTX fell victim to a hack. The attacker carted off crypto assets including gold-backed Paxos Gold which altogether added up to $400M in stolen funds. </p>\n<p>When the hack initially occurred, Paxos took swift action and froze 11,184 Paxos Gold tied to 4 Ethereum wallets. The company revealed in an update that they had done this in compliance with instructions from US Federal Law enforcement. Per a Dec 23 t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1606116338514087936?s=20&amp;t=8wZPY2Mh5sHFCtI0XzLqSg\">weet</a> from blockchain security firm Peckshield, over a month since the freeze, the 11,184 PAXG tokens have returned to Paxos’ possession.</p>\n<p>The Peckshield post stated that the blockchain firm transferred the stolen funds from wallets tagged “FTX Accounts Drainer.” According to Etherscan data Paxos then deposited the tokens in a null address and burned them. Following this, the platform minted the same number of tokens to the treasury wallet and subsequently sent the funds to a fresh address. \nNotably, before Peckshield revealed that Paxos had moved the tokens, reports made the rounds claiming the hacker was behind the transfers. The tweet of course worked to silence the speculation. </p>\n<p>With this move, Paxos has only recovered a minimal percentage of the funds the hacker stole in the exploit. Indeed, the perpetrator’s wallet had contained over $300M in ether from FTX’s reserves in the weeks following the hack. The culprit swapped the majority of these assets for <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">BTC</a>, rendering them unrecoverable. </p>\n<h2 id=\"ripple-may-be-introducing-smart-contracts-to-the-xrp-ledger\">Ripple May be Introducing Smart Contracts to the XRP Ledger</h2>\n<p>Matt Hamilton, ex-Principal Developer Advocate at Ripple <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HammerToe/status/1605721014813573120?s=20&amp;t=4dhOaJh6F0KRmF1EeQ6EEg\">revealed</a> that some major functionality is coming to the payment firm’s blockchain, XRP ledger. Hamilton shared the news on Thursday, in response to a Twitter user’s statement claiming the network had no utility. The user questioned why any financial institutions would adopt altcoins when they didn’t want Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>“I don’t see any use case,” said the tweet.</p>\n<p>Hamilton chimed in to note that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HammerToe/status/1605721014813573120?s=20&amp;t=4dhOaJh6F0KRmF1EeQ6EEg\">XRP</a> sees daily use as a tool for international payments, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and web monetization. However, another user @BrainsyEth pointed out that XRPL does offer support for smart contracts.

In fact, the top coins on the losers’ table made double-digit losses. This was opposite to what was seen in the gainers’ leaderboard. Only XDC Network (XDC) recorded profits in double digits, while the rest made percentages that were at or close to the zero mark. As a matter of fact, the global market lost $82 billion in total capitalization this week, before gaining $24B in the last 24 hours. At writing the total market cap sits at $849 billion. </p>\n<p>With Christmas approaching, crypto investors are anticipating a market upturn since this has been the trend in the last three years. However, this past week showed that they would have to still wrestle with the bears for some time before the market makes a move toward value. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> traded at $17,810 at the beginning of the week. But unlike the previous week where it accumulated value, the premier cryptocurrency lost some of its value to trade at $16,868 by the end of the week. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> followed a similar trajectory, dropping to $1,215 from $1,323.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_21_market_recap_01_63bb61a6ff.png\" alt=\"12.21 crypto market recap\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"top-gainers-xdc-leads-with-a-wide-margin\">Top Gainers: XDC Leads With A Wide Margin</h2>\n<h3 id=\"xdc-network-xdc\">XDC Network (XDC)</h3>\n<p>It may seem as though <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xdc\">XDC</a> is (still) reaping the dividends of its <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/xdc-liquidity-mining-campaign-led-by-hummingbot-is-a-best-move-for-bringing-larger-community-to-provide-liquidity/\">liquidity campaign</a> launched by Hummingbot. A few weeks ago, the DeFi market-making software platform led a 12-week liquidity mining campaign on behalf of XDC. The aim of the campaign was to “unify large communities to provide liquidity.”</p>\n<p>Three weeks into the campaign and XDC is gaining momentum. This past week saw it gaining over 23% as it journeyed from $0.023 and peaked at $0.028.</p>\n<h3 id=\"immutable-x-imx\">Immutable X (IMX)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/immutable-x\">IMX</a> which had a spot in the losers&#39; table the previous week experienced a plot twist in the last seven days. In a not-so-impressive run to gain 2.40%, the token moved from $0.44 at the start of the week and touched $0.47 before settling at $0.45.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fei-usd-fei\">Fei USD (FEI)</h3>\n<p>Since the collapse of UST, crypto investors have been skeptical about stablecoins, especially algorithmic stablecoins. So it&#39;s quite unexpected to see <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/fei\">FEI</a> on the gainers&#39; chart. Last week, the coin danced between $0.99 and $1.00, culminating in a value gain of 0.79%.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tron-trx\">Tron (TRX)</h3>\n<p>Tron&#39;s <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tron\">TRX</a> had positive news this past week. It&#39;s reported that with a TVL of $4.30 billion, the token surpassed Binance&#39;s BSC to become the cryptocurrency with the second-highest total value locked (TVL). </p>\n<p>However, TRX hasn&#39;t been able to respond strongly to this news. Spiking from $0.055 to $0.058 at the beginning of the week, it returned to its $0.055 base by the end of the week. With only a 0.30% gain, the token may shed more value soon as its red candles are slowly taking over the greens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pax-gold-paxg\">PAX Gold (PAXG)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/pax-gold\">PAXG</a> managed to creep into the gainers&#39; leaderboard with a gain of 0.02%. It opened the week at $1,804, then plunged to $1,776. However, in a show of resilience, the coin recovered and closed the week at $1,816.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-losers-xcn-and-fil-lead-the-trend-of-double-digit-losses\">Top Losers: XCN and FIL Lead the Trend of Double-Digit Losses</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chain-xcn\">Chain (XCN)</h3>\n<p>Unlike IMX which found its way out of the losers&#39; table this past week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xcn-chain\">XCN</a> was chained to the table and even occupied the number 1 spot.  The coin which had lost 11% the previous week, went on to lose 39.45% last week. It made a steep descent to $0.02046 from $0.034.</p>\n<h3 id=\"filecoin-fil\">Filecoin (FIL)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/filecoin\">FIL</a> faced intense selling pressure last week. It registered massive losses of up to 32.18% as it tanked from $4.36 to trade at $2.93.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust-wallet-token-twt\">Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</h3>\n<p>This past week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/twt\">TWT</a> was also hit by the distrust and loss of faith plaguing the market. The native token of Trust Wallet witnessed massive selloffs and shed 31.14% of its value. The token which traded at $2.29 at the beginning of the week, fell to $1.30 within three days, before trudging to $1.55.</p>\n<h3 id=\"near-protocol-near\">NEAR Protocol (NEAR)</h3>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/near\">NEAR</a> reached a <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/near-investors-could-be-skeptical-about-celebrating-this-milestone-because/\">milestone</a> of 250 million transactions. However, this feat didn&#39;t rule out that, given current market dynamics, NEAR&#39;s journey towards amassing value is quite far. The cryptocurrency lost over 23%—falling from $1.72 to $1.30.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-sandbox-sand\">The Sandbox (SAND)</h3>\n<p>The Sandbox had major headlines this past week. The Sandbox was OpenZeppelin’s first client as the latter <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/195351/openzeppelin-releases-metaverse-security-service-signs-up-the-sandbox-as-client\">launched</a> its metaverse security service. Also, The Sandbox entered a <a href=\"https://sandboxgame.medium.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-wunderman-thompson-to-develop-new-experiences-in-the-metaverse-fbac1b526e91?source=rss-22d1079b43b4------2\">partnership</a> with advertising company Wunderman Thompson to provide decentralized entertainment content to the latter&#39;s clients. Forbes also announced that it would <a href=\"https://medium.com/sandbox-game/forbes-partners-with-the-sandbox-and-enters-the-metaverse-with-an-interactive-multiplayer-614c2305468\">launch</a> its metaverse hub through The Sandbox.</p>\n<p>However, these headlines were not rock-solid enough to hold <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/the-sandbox\">SAND</a>&#39;s value. Last week saw the token’s value cave in as if it stood on quicksand. It lost 22.37%, plummeting to $0.44 from $0.57.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-12-21T14:26:27.740Z","createdAt":"2022-12-21T14:26:24.203Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-21T14:26:27.765Z"},{"id":1360,"title":"Weekly Wrap: PayPal Strikes MetaMask Partnership","description":"Partnership between PayPal and Consensys means its U.S. customers can now trade crypto directly on a PayPal account.

Damian Williams, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced the arrest in a Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1602451395910803457?s=20&amp;t=xRsUbQjJrlvUSuvQBcsspA\">post</a>. \nWilliams noted that the arrest reportedly took place at the request of the U.S. government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,&quot; - Damian Williams</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder stated that the U.S. was primed to request Bankman-Fried&#39;s extradition. According to Pinder&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oagbahamas/status/1602477971763347456?s=20&amp;t=ECXfWZiAaIAy7PKujjHM4A\">statement</a>, the Bahamas is set to comply. Prime Minister of the Bahamas Philip Davis also spoke on the situation. \nIn his statement, Davis noted that both regions involved in SBF&#39;s arrest had a common interest. Both US and Bahamian authorities aimed to see those with ties to FTX take responsibility for betraying public trust and breaking the law. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX with the continued cooperation of its law enforcement and regulatory partners in the United States and elsewhere.&quot; - Philip Davis, Prime Minister of the Bahamas </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"paypal-and-consensys-partner-for-seamless-crypto-transactions\">PayPal and ConsenSys Partner for Seamless Crypto Transactions</h2>\n<p>Payments network PayPal has entered into a collaboration with blockchain software firm ConsenSys. News of the partnership emerged via a Dec 14 release which shared further details surrounding the move.</p>\n<p>Per the release, ConsenSys&#39; MetaMask wallet will now support payments giant PayPal&#39;s buy, sell and hold crypto offering. Indeed, the collaboration should see users easily purchase and transfer ETH from PayPal to MetaMask. All they have to do is log into their MetaMask mobile app, which will redirect them to their PayPal accounts to process transactions. \nMetaMask product manager Lorenzo Santos explained the partnership would first leverage on U.S. customers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;This integration with PayPal will allow our U.S. users to not just buy crypto seamlessly through MetaMask, but also to easily explore the Web3 ecosystem.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ConsenSys updated users in a blog post where they revealed that the new functionality would be open to a select group. Indeed, only eligible U.S. customers, except those based in Hawaii, have access to PayPal&#39;s services on MetaMask. \nThe PayPal partnership is the software company&#39;s latest move to ease the purchase process for MetaMask users. In October, ConsenSys joined forces with fiscal firm Sardines to allow customers to make crypto purchases straight from their bank accounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-merge-prompts-rise-in-btc-hash-rate\">Ethereum Merge Prompts Rise in BTC Hash Rate</h2>\n<p>In the months following Ethereum&#39;s widely-anticipated <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">merge</a>, an interesting development has surfaced on the mining scene. The <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> hash rate, the computational power used to mine and process transactions, has significantly risen. BTC saw its hash rate hit an all-time high of 250 EH/s (quintillion hashes per second) in late October.</p>\n<p>Blockchain analysis firm CoinMetrics&#39; Dec 13 <a href=\"https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/state-of-the-network-issue-185\">issue</a> of its &#39;State of the Network&#39; newsletter noted the growth of the BTC hash rate. The release also acknowledged the role of the merge in the noteworthy increase:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to put an exact figure on the magnitude of this resource reallocation, but Bitcoin hash rate grew quickly from 220 EH/s to 250 EH/s shortly after the completion of The Merge in September.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ethereum Merge <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/the-merge-explained-one-step-closer-to-scalable-ethereum\">entailed</a> the network&#39;s transition from Proof-of-Work to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Indeed, transaction validation on Ethereum no longer calls for miners. Rather validators are randomly selected, with how many coins they have staked being part of the criteria. </p>\n<p>Following the shift, former Ethereum miners have switched from Ethereum mining operations to Bitcoin mining. Hence, the influx of miners has seen the BTC hash rate surge in the past few months. The rise comes despite recent turbulence in the crypto space. Indeed, following the FTX crash and other incidents, the premier token has seen its value drop to record lows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-usage-in-nigeria-may-be-legalized-soon\">Bitcoin Usage in Nigeria May be Legalized Soon</h2>\n<p>According to recent reports by a local newspaper, Nigeria may be about to legalize the usage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This claim was attributed to the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Capital Markets and Institutions of Nigeria. According to the report, Ibrahim Babangida, the chairman, explained that Nigeria needs an &quot;efficient and vibrant capital market.&quot; Babaginda explained that this could only be possible if African nations keep up with evolving global practices.</p>\n<p>The Bitcoin bill, if passed, would be an amendment to the 2007 Investments and Securities Act. It would allow Bitcoin to be recognized as a viable capital for investment in the country. Although Bitcoin was banned in Nigeria in 2021, it has managed to thrive actively, according to Chainalysis. In fact, that same year, it recorded the highest peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volume in the world, as well as in West Africa. Indeed, the king of crypto has a large presence in the country. In August, Nigeria <a href=\"https://watcher.guru/news/this-country-is-building-a-bitcoin-village-heres-why-its-important\">kickstarted</a> its first construction of a &#39;Bitcoin village&#39; while mining activities are beginning to amp up in some parts of the country. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":6,"name":"News","description":"Latest cryptocurrency news.

Last week, the king crypto grew by 4.5%, undulating from $16,980 to $17,759. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> also trod a similar path to value.

The fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) found its way to the gainers’ leaderboard with a gain of 10.72%. It moved steadily from $41.6 to $45.97 by the end of the week. </p>\n<h3 id=\"okb-okb\">OKB (OKB)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/okb\">OKB</a>’s price history in recent weeks has shown that the token is a resilient one despite market turmoil. And this past week was no different. The token accrued a value of 8.85% as it journeyed from $21.0 at the start of the week to $23.02, where it currently trades.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dash-dash\">Dash (DASH)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dash\">DASH</a>’s move towards accruing value was swift and small. However, it was sufficient for it to hold a spot on the gainers’ table. The coin opened the week with a market price of $47.4, and descended to $44.0, before printing a 2% gain to trade at $49.5.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bitdao-bit\">BitDAO (BIT)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitdao\">BIT</a> traded at $0.30 and traded sideways for the most part of the week, moving between $0.30 and $0.31. But as the week drew to a close, the token surged to $0.33, recording an increase of 8.4%. </p>\n<h2 id=\"top-losers-chz-xcn-disappoint\">Top Losers: CHZ, XCN Disappoint</h2>\n<h3 id=\"flow-flow\">Flow (FLOW)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/flow\">FLOW</a> has been unable to get value to flow to it for a while now. Investors have been selling the coin massively to cut their losses and reduce their exposure to the turbulent market. Last week, FLOW traded at $1.090 at the start of the week, dropping to $1.040 where it traded for some days, before plummeting to $0.90. This price movement culminated in a 12.52% loss for the coin.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"chiliz-chz\">Chiliz (CHZ)</h3>\n<p>As a sport-themed cryptocurrency, many anticipated <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/chiliz\">CHZ</a> to be one of the most valuable players in the market throughout the World Cup period. This would have been the case. However, FTX’s collapse blocked any chance for the coin to score some gains.  </p>\n<p>This past week, the crypto followed a price path akin to FLOW’s as it lost 12.05%. It opened the week at $0.158, then dropped to $0.150. It traded around the $0.150 region for some days before making a sudden descent to $0.133. </p>\n<h3 id=\"chain-xcn\">Chain (XCN)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xcn-chain\">XCN</a>’s price movement within the first few days of the week would have made one predict that it would sit among the top gainers. The coin started the week at a market price of $0.038 and later surged above $0.040. However, there was a sudden twist as it began to slide down the foodchain. It descended gradually from $0.041 to $0.033, losing over 11%.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dogecoin-doge\">Dogecoin (DOGE)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dogecoin\">DOGE</a> is one memecoin that has enjoyed the spotlight, especially after it piqued Elon Musk’s interest. When the latter acquired Twitter, DOGE <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/dogecoin-surges-40percent-as-elon-musks-twitter-deal-approaches-close.html\">soared</a> because many expected the billionaire to incorporate the coin into the microblogging platform. However, being the favorite coin of the billionaire has not made it immune from the fear and uncertainty rocking the market. Recent weeks have seen DOGE shed its value massively; a trend which also stretched into this past week. DOGE experienced massive sell-offs, causing it to lose over 9% as it plunged to $0.088 from $0.097. </p>\n<h3 id=\"axie-infinity-axs\">Axie Infinity (AXS)</h3>\n<p>After a bull run some weeks ago, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/axie-infinity\">AXS</a> lost 12.08% of its value this past week. Its chart showed red candlesticks descending the value ladder, as the coin dropped from $8.73 to $7.67. </p>\n<h3 id=\"immutablex-imx\">ImmutableX (IMX)</h3>\n<p>Like its counterpart, AXS, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/immutable-x\">IMX</a> did not have a good run this past week. The gaming token shed 7.14% of its value, crashing from $0.47 to $0.42, even plunging to $0.41.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-12-15T10:07:05.229Z","createdAt":"2022-12-15T10:07:02.793Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T10:07:05.249Z"},{"id":1356,"title":"Weekly Wrap: Crypto Tax Proposal May Jeopardize User Data","description":"An EU crypto tax proposal is raising privacy concerns.

Describing the decision as regrettable but crucial, Nexo cited a lack of regulatory clarity as the main driver.</p>\n<p>The platform published a blog <a href=\"https://t.co/dPmYZ0lyhy\">post</a> stating that it had been in talks with US authorities for over a year. Per the release, the goal was to figure out a plan for compliance. However, following discussions, Nexo has concluded that the US is not prepared to provide adequate regulatory structures for blockchain-based businesses.  </p>\n<p>Nexo has already withdrawn its services from New York and Vermont and paused registrations for its Earn Interest product.

The firm revealed this in a tweet on Dec 6 stating that they were committed to protecting user privacy. </p>\n<p>On November 24, ConsenSys amended its privacy policy to clarify how Infura (MetaMask&#39;s default RPC) manages user data including IP addresses. The disclosure resulted in an uproar as crypto users raised concerns about their privacy. </p>\n<p>In the new update, ConsenSys explained that it does not collect data relating to read requests such as account checks. Rather, it collects wallet and IP address information in connection with transactions. Per its data retention policy, the company retains and deletes user data but is now working to shorten retention to 7 days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"us-judge-orders-celsius-to-return-44m-to-customers\">US Judge Orders Celsius to Return $44M to Customers</h2>\n<p>According to a Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-07/celsius-judge-orders-return-of-user-crypto-worth-50-million?leadSource=uverify%20wall\">report</a>, failed crypto lender Celsius Network has received court orders to refund $44M worth of crypto to users. Federal bankruptcy judge Martin Glenn delivered the ruling verbally during a Dec 7 hearing. </p>\n<p>The ruling applies exclusively to custodial accounts. Additionally, it only affects pure custody assets, assets that have never interacted with Celsius’s Earn accounts. Notably, the ruling came after Celsius advisers and stakeholders agreed that funds from custody accounts belonged to clients and not the network. </p>\n<p>Indeed, Celsius argues that users with Earn accounts relinquished rights to their assets when they agreed to the company’s terms of service. Glenn noted his thoughts on the issue during the hearing;</p>\n<p><em>“I want this case to move forward,”</em> he said. <em>“I want creditors to recover as much as they possibly can as soon as they possibly can.”</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"nomad-shares-plans-for-bridge-relaunch-after-190m-august-hack\">Nomad Shares Plans for Bridge Relaunch After $190M August Hack</h2>\n<p>In a Dec 7 <a href=\"https://medium.com/nomad-xyz-blog/nomad-bridge-relaunch-guide-3a4ef6624f90\">update</a> on its official blog, cross-chain bridge protocol Nomad has unveiled plans to relaunch. After the August hack that saw the platform record $190M in losses, Nomad is finally ready to offer users partial refunds. </p>\n<p>Per the post, the steps involved in the bridge relaunch include smart contract upgrades, which have been completed, and KYC verification which is still open. Nomad called for victims of the hack to undergo verification via CEX and launchpad platform CoinList in order to receive their refunds. </p>\n<p>Following the KYC process, customers will receive a non-fungible token (NFT) that gives them a proportional share of the recovered funds on the Ethereum blockchain. These non-transferable NFTs will allow them to receive future funds. Nomad is also carrying out front-end testing which is still ongoing but they claim will be completed shortly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"starbucks-commences-beta-testing-for-nft-loyalty-program\">Starbucks Commences Beta Testing for NFT Loyalty Program</h2>\n<p>Multinational coffee giant Starbucks has kicked off beta testing for its web3 loyalty program and NFT community. Dubbed Starbucks Odyssey, the program is currently open to the US-based group of its first beta testers. Starbucks shared the announcement in a Dec 8 <a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2022/the-starbucks-odyssey-begins/\">release</a>. </p>\n<p>The Polygon-native program is part of the company’s existing customer reward structure, Starbucks rewards. News of the project first emerged in September this year as the restaurant chain took steps toward its Web3 venture. Starbucks Odyssey coffee-themed non-fungible tokens that can extend to real-world experiences. </p>\n<p>Beneath the program customers will have access to perks outside of typical rewards like free drinks. Indeed, Starbucks is unveiling a platform where customers interact by participating in activities called journeys. They get to complete coffee and Starbucks-focused quizzes and try out new drinks, earning tokenized journey stamps along the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eu-may-force-crypto-businesses-to-reveal-user-holdings-to-authorities\">EU May Force Crypto Businesses to Reveal User Holdings to Authorities</h2>\n<p>In a statement on Thursday, the European Union hinted at plans to make crypto firms reveal user assets to tax authorities. The proposed eighth Directive on Administrative Cooperation, or DAC8, aims to stop taxpayers from avoiding billions of euros in payments by storing crypto overseas. However, the authorities are determined to enforce tax laws for crypto users residing in the EU. </p>\n<p><em>“Anonymity means that many crypto-asset users making significant profits fall under the radar of national tax authorities. This is not acceptable,”</em> Paolo Gentiloni, EU commissioner for tax stressed. </p>\n<p>According to Gentiloni, the commission is reviewing how forthcoming measures will apply to crypto service providers outside EU jurisdiction. The tax plan requires external entities with EU clients to register and report within the bloc. However, this may be an issue given that crypto companies are largely online and sometimes claim not to have headquarters at all.</p>\n<p>The tax plan may also prove problematic considering that it forces firms to collect large quantities of user data. This includes sensitive identifying information that malicious actors could use to link people with their assets making them targets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coinbase-encourages-users-to-drop-usdt-for-usdc-waives-swap-fees\">Coinbase Encourages Users to Drop USDT for USDC, Waives Swap Fees</h2>\n<p>In a Thursday blog <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/blog/switch-to-the-trusted-and-reputable-digital-dollar-usdc\">post</a>, leading crypto platform, Coinbase pushed for customers to swap stablecoin USDT for the “trusted and reputable” USDC.</p>\n<p>Coinbase highlighted the need for trust in their release alluding to the turmoil of the past month; FTX’s disastrous crash. The post claimed that fiat-back stablecoins were a good option for customers seeking stable ground amid the widespread volatility. </p>\n<p>The exchange cited Circle’s stablecoin USDC as a reliable asset and shared plans to make it easier for users to adopt the token. As such, Coinbase is eliminating fees for USDT to USDC conversions for retail clients worldwide.</p>\n<p>The exchange pointed out USDC’s dedication to transparency and may have taken a swing at USDC rival Tether’s USDT stablecoin in its statement. It is worthy of note that Tether lost its peg to the dollar, trading under $0.95 during the FTX debacle.</p>\n<p>Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino is yet to share a direct response to Coinbase’s latest move. So far, Ardoino has only retweeted posts defending Tether. One was a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1601020841135071233?s=20&amp;t=XK3bJF1pfVKysv5tzQdvNg\">tweet</a> from crypto analyst Byzantine General.</p>\n<p><em>“Not a good look.

This came after an attempted market manipulation attack from Avraham Eisenberg, the trader behind October’s Mango exploit.</p>\n<p>Eisenberg borrowed up to 40M CRV tokens on Aave intending to sell the tokens and drive down the asset’s value. He shared his plans to make a profit on short positions on Twitter, however, the attempt ultimately failed. In the wake of this, Gauntlet submitted a proposal calling for Aave to pause assets that posed volatility risks. </p>\n<p>Some of the affected tokens include earn.Finance (YFI), Curve DAO (CRV), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), Maker (MKR), and 1inch (1INCH). Following the suspension users will no longer be able to deposit these assets or take loans with them on the platform. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/weekly_recap_aave_f40e43e5af.png\" alt=\"weekly recap aave\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"blockfi-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection\">BlockFi Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</h2>\n<p>According to a Monday <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221128005451/en/\">announcement</a>, crypto lender BlockFi has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it struggles with liquidity following the FTX crash. The lender alongside 8 of its affiliates submitted the <a href=\"https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/109/1094078/118164199368.pdf\">application</a> to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. </p>\n<p>Notably, the filing uncovered the state of the lending platforms assets and liabilities which both lie between $1-$10 billion. According to the application, BlockFi has more than 100,000 creditors with Ankura Trust Company leading them all. Ankura has unsecured claims worth $730 million while West Realm Shires Inc, FTX US’s business name, trails behind with a $275M unsecured claim. </p>\n<p>BlockFi has shared plans to restructure and create an operational model that proves advantageous for customers and other stakeholders. </p>\n<h2 id=\"russias-sber-bank-announces-ethereum-compatibility\">Russia’s Sber Bank Announces Ethereum Compatibility</h2>\n<p>Per a <a href=\"https://press.sber.ru/publications/sber-predstavil-novye-vozmozhnosti-svoei-blokchein-platformy\">release</a> on Nov 30, Russia’s largest bank Sber has further advanced its venture into the blockchain space. Indeed, the institution’s proprietary blockchain platform will be compatible with the world’s leading defi network, the Ethereum blockchain. Following the integration, developers on the Sber platform will be able to facilitate interactions between the bank&#39;s blockchain network and open blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>Sber shared the news during the first international meeting of participants in the corporate blockchain industry. Notably, the Sber Blockchain Laboratory put the event together. In addition to Ethereum compatibility, Sber is set to bring ConsenSys’ MetaMask wallet onboard. Sber users will be able to conduct operations with tokens and smart contracts the platform supports. </p>\n<p>Alexander Nam, head of the blockchain lab commented on the new functionality. He believes it will let Sber unite the relevant entities to explore practical blockchain, Web3, and DeFi business use cases. </p>\n<h2 id=\"ankr-helio-lose-20m-in-linked-attacks\">Ankr, Helio Lose $20M in Linked Attacks</h2>\n<p>Infrastructure provider Ankr alongside stablecoin issuer Helio suffered combined losses of $20M due to recent, connected security breaches. </p>\n<p>The attacker’s first target was Ankr. On December 1, the perpetrator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1598491115887661056?s=20&amp;t=-MLIhZ8s65Gbh9AB6HGppA\">exploited</a> one of the firm’s offerings, a liquid staking token product. They were able to gain access via a gap in the smart contract and mint trillions of aBNBc, a reward token tied to the price of Binance’s BNB.</p>\n<p>Following this, they moved and swapped the funds using services UniSwap, PancakeSwap, and Tornado Cash ultimately ending up with $5M in USDC.</p>\n<p>The second breach saw the attacker get their hands on over 180k aBNBc tokens with 10 BNB ($2,900). Using some of the funds as collateral on the Helio protocol, they were able to borrow $16M worth of the HAY stablecoin. As Helio’s oracle was yet to update aBNBc prices after it fell due to the first exploit, the perpetrator only needed a small quantity for collateral.</p>\n<p>The attacker then exchanged the HAY for $15M Binance USD (BUSD), resulting in major losses for Helio.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"former-sec-officials-tags-tether-a-ponzi-scheme\">Former SEC Officials Tags Tether a Ponzi Scheme</h2>\n<p>In a tweet on Friday, Dec 2 ex-Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement official John Reed slammed stablecoin platform Tether. Reed called out the firm’s alleged lack of transparency in response to a CNBC interview with Tether co-creator Reeve Collins. During the interview, Collins was asked to address Tether’s failure to fully disclose its reserves following FTX’s anxiety-inducing crash. </p>\n<p>Collins dismissed speculation that Tether was hiding something, instead noting that the USDT token had maintained its $1 peg thus far. </p>\n<p>Unsatisfied by the response, Reeds claimed Tether could be operating a Ponzi scheme. </p>\n<p><em>“Wow, tell us Tether is running a Ponzi scheme without telling us that Tether is running a Ponzi scheme. Just listen to his answers. IMHO, as a former SEC enforcement official of 18 yrs, the evasion/deflection/lack of responsiveness makes me believe Tether is a house of cards,”</em> the former SEC official said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"judge-dismisses-warrant-for-tfl-co-founder-daniel-shin\">Judge Dismisses Warrant for TFL Co-founder Daniel Shin</h2>\n<p>According to local news agency Yonhap news, a South Korean court has dismissed the arrest warrant for Terra co-founder Daniel Shin. Hong Jin-Pyo, the chief judge in charge of warrants at the Seoul Southern District Court, explained the dismissal.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Considering the attitude toward the investigation, the circumstances, process, and contents of the statement, it is difficult to see that there is a risk of destroying evidence or escaping beyond the scope of exercising the right to legitimate defense,&quot;</em> he said.</p>\n<p>Shin was not the defendant whose warrant was dismissed. Three early investors and four Terra developers also saw their warrants canceled for the same reason. A TFL representative cited the development as proof that the prosecutors’ allegations against Terra are unfounded. </p>\n<p>Do-Kwon’s warrant remains active as his whereabouts are still unknown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"empiresx-head-trader-receives-4-year-sentence-due-to-role-in-ponzi-scheme\">EmpiresX Head Trader Receives 4-year Sentence Due to Role in Ponzi Scheme</h2>\n<p>A United States court has handed a 4-year sentence to one of the main players in the $100M crypto Ponzi scheme EmpireX. Indeed, Joshua David Nicholas, the platform’s head trader, has received 51 months of jail time for his role in the fraudulent scheme. Nicholas will also face three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>According to the DOJ, Nicholas had claimed EmpiresX would provide users daily &quot;guaranteed&quot; returns utilizing a trading bot that used &quot;artificial and human intelligence.” In truth, the bot was fake and the purported earnings were funds from earlier investors. Nicholas ran the scheme for about two years with associates Pires and Goncalves (now believed to be in Brazil) until it crashed in 2022.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":6,"name":"News","description":"Latest cryptocurrency news.

As such, the hacker was able to drain the affected address of 8,233,180 $USDC, 1,607 $ETH, 719,760 $USDT, and 4.13 $BTC.</p>\n<p>This attack is the second time Shen has suffered losses at the hands of malicious actors. The VC has involved the FBI and lawyers in the case. </p>\n<p><em>“Civilization and justice will eventually prevail over barbarism and evil. This is the iron law of human society. It’s just a matter of time,”</em> said Shen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/11_28_weekly_recap_Artboard_1_a51682b006.png\" alt=\"Weekly Wrap: Russia and El Salvador Create Crypto Structures\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"russia-to-establish-national-crypto-exchange\">Russia to Establish National Crypto Exchange</h2>\n<p>According to a local <a href=\"https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2022/11/23/951646-v-gosdume-nachali-podgotovku-regulirovaniya-rossiiskoi-kriptobirzhi\">report</a> from Nov 23, Russia is working on a draft policy for a national crypto exchange. Despite their unfavorable stance towards crypto regulation thus far, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Russia are behind the ongoing effort. </p>\n<p>Per the publication, members of the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly of Russia, the State Duma, are deliberating over the issue. Indeed, lawmakers are looking to review existing regulations to accommodate an exchange. Market stakeholders are part of the discussion as Russia’s current crypto policy “Digital financial markets” may see a complete overhaul. </p>\n<p>The revamped policy will establish a regulatory structure for a national crypto exchange. However, the plan is to first prepare a document looking into current market conditions. The document will then make its way to the government and the Bank of Russia for discussion. Sergey Altuhov, a member of the Economic Policy Committee lightly touched on the nation’s motivation for the forthcoming move;</p>\n<p><em>“It makes no sense to deny the existence of cryptocurrencies, the problem is they circulate in a large stream outside of state regulation,”</em> he said. <em>“These are billions of tax rubles of lost tax revenues to the federal budget.”</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"binance-commits-2b-to-its-industry-recovery-initiative\">Binance Commits $2B to its Industry Recovery Initiative</h2>\n<p>Following crypto exchange FTX’s historic fallout, another key industry player stepped up to aid platforms in a liquidity crisis due to the crash. </p>\n<p>Indeed, Binance announced plans for an industry recovery fund and has since followed through. In a Thursday blog <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/web3-leaders-join-binance-to-spearhead-web3-industry-recovery-initiative-5285759314040744618\">post</a>, the exchange pledged $1B to the initiative. Binance claimed that it could raise that figure to $2 billion in the future should the need arise and did so shortly after.</p>\n<p><em>“Yesterday, #Binance allocated ANOTHER $1 billion to the industry recovery initiative. All in BUSD,”</em> CEO Changpeng Zhao announced in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1596024244537737216?s=20&amp;t=LrQfz4ZstaNy6I0N488O8Q\">tweet</a>.</p>\n<p>Thus far, Jump Crypto, Polygon Ventures, Aptos Labs, Animoca Brands, GSR, Kronos, and Brooker Group have also delivered an initial commitment totaling $50M. Binance noted that roughly 150 firms have put in applications for aid beneath the project. Per the report, the scheme should run for about 6 months and will feature a flexible investment structure. </p>\n<p>The initiative will include instruments such as crypto tokens, fiat currencies, equity, debt, or credit lines depending on individual needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"el-salvador-creates-national-bitcoin-office\">El Salvador Creates National Bitcoin Office</h2>\n<p>According to a LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/el-salvador-creates-national-bitcoin-office-torres-legal\">post</a> from November 25, El Salvador’s government has established a National Bitcoin office as it furthers its Bitcoin strategy. Dubbed the ONBTC, the office will be in charge of all developments relating to the country’s dealings with the premier cryptocurrency. </p>\n<p>Indeed, the ONBTC will handle all aspects of plans, programs, and projects with ties to Bitcoin for the growth of El Salvador’s economy. It will coordinate all efforts to set up proper regulation for the nation’s crypto scene. The ONBTC will also have to assess and keep track of all persons seeking meetings with Bitcoin-friendly President Nayib Bukele regarding Bitcoin and Blockchain implementation in El Salvador.</p>\n<p>Notably, the office will be able to partner with other nations concerning Bitcoin-related issues. </p>\n<p><em>“The new agency will work as a specialized administrative unit, with functional and technical autonomy within the Presidency of the Republic,”</em> the post read.</p>\n<p>Bukele will appoint the Director of the agency who in turn will hire other necessary personnel. </p>\n<h2 id=\"kraken-founder-criticizes-absence-of-liabilities-in-binance-proof-of-reserves\">Kraken Founder Criticizes Absence of Liabilities in Binance Proof of Reserves</h2>\n<p>Kraken Founder and soon-to-be ex-CEO Jesse Powell blasted Binance over its recently published proof-of-reserves in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1596227031637045248?s=20&amp;t=o6I2JygyoE-A254co7ZydQ\">tweet</a> on Saturday. The FTX saga sheds light on the need for transparency from exchanges to prevent more cases like the beleaguered firm’s. As such crypto exchanges have been publishing proof-of-reserves, and sharing wallet addresses to verify their holdings of user assets.</p>\n<p>Powell’s issues with the trend focus mainly on the failure to include liabilities in the audit. Indeed, Binance’s proof-of-reserves system allows clients to verify their assets using a Merkle tree. However, Powell pointed out that the system did not include customer accounts with negative balances.</p>\n<p><em>“This is simply ‘here&#39;s a hash of your record in the BTC spreadsheet’. ok... but what&#39;s the point? The whole point of this is to understand whether an exchange has more crypto in its custody than it owes to clients. Putting a hash on a row ID is worthless without everything else,”</em> he said.</p>\n<p>At writing, Binance is yet to acknowledge or reply to the Kraken boss’ criticisms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mango-market-hacker-leaves-aave-with-16m-bad-debt-in-failed-exploit\">Mango Market Hacker Leaves Aave with $1.6M Bad Debt in Failed Exploit</h2>\n<p>Avraham Eisenberg, the trader behind October’s $100M Mango Market hack attempted a similar exploit with crypto lending platform Aave. </p>\n<p>Eisenberg outed himself after the Mango attack as his actions were entirely above board. The trader took a similar approach to the Aave attempt, working within the confines of the code. However, he failed this time, losing millions in the process.</p>\n<p>From Nov 14 Eisenberg gathered a loan of 92M curve tokens from the platform using $50M worth of USDC as collateral. Subsequently, he began building a massive short position; swapping the CRV for USDC on CEX OKX to borrow more CRV and repeat the process. Analysts suggest that his goal may have been to bring down the token’s price to drive CRV-collateralized loans to liquidation. </p>\n<p>Curve founder Michael Egorov had a $48M loan that would have been liquidated had CRV dropped under $0.29. However, Eisenberg’s plans were cut short after an address connected to Egorov added 20M more CRV in collateral. Despite his apparent failure, Eisenberg’s scheme did leave Aave with $1.6M in bad debt.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":6,"name":"News","description":"Latest cryptocurrency news.

The total crypto market cap is seated at $821B recording a $28B decline in the past week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> reclaimed the $16,000 price point on Tuesday, however, this came after the token sank to a two-year low. Indeed, the premier cryptocurrency dropped to $15,480 on Monday as it continues to battle contagion from FTX’s collapse. BTC bounced back on the news that Cathie Wood&#39;s Ark Investment Management had purchased $1.5 million in Grayscale&#39;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). At writing, Bitcoin is trading at $16,536, although the king crypto isn’t out of the woods just yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">ETH</a> saw its value drop 5.63% over the past week amid fears of a <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/weekly-recap-exchanges-publish-transparent-records-after-ftx-crash\">dump</a> by an FTX hacker. Ethereum dropped to a 3-month low of  $1,081 on Tuesday, after starting the week trading at around $1.2k.

As a lesser-known coin, the token surprised market participants as it charged past the bears to record the majority of its gains; an 8000% surge in just 24 hours that saw it peak at $13.54. SNM had earlier been trading steadily at about $0.20, and following its sudden upswing, the token took a nosedive prompting speculations of a pump-and-dump scheme. At writing, SNM is worth $0.9173 and seems set to drop further.</p>\n<h3 id=\"phoenix-phb\">Phoenix (PHB)</h3>\n<p>Next-gen blockchain Phoenix Global saw its native token accrue gains worth 72.44% over the past seven days. The digital coin embarked on a rally in the middle of the week after consolidating within the  $0.410 price range. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/phoenix-global\">PHB</a> soared to a weekly high of $1.17 but has retraced to sit at $0.6373 at press time while still retaining some of its bullish momentum. </p>\n<h3 id=\"litecoin-ltc\">Litecoin (LTC)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin\">LTC</a> swam against the tide this past week and was able to chart an almost 35% increase in value despite the unfavorable market conditions. The token traded unsteadily just above $60 for the majority of the week and began pumping on Tuesday ultimately hitting a 3-month high of $81.56. Some reports claim traders are turning to the token following the FTX fallout due to its reputation for stability. LTC is worth $79.84, up 28.92% over the past day. </p>\n<h3 id=\"voyager-vgx\">Voyager (VGX)</h3>\n<p>On the back of news that Binance.US may be set to relaunch its bid for the failed platform, Voyager Digital’s native token added 23.29% to its value this week. An Ethos announcement regarding a token recovery program for victims of the lender’s bankruptcy further boosted the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/voyager-token\">Voyager</a> token’s value. The upsurge saw VGX chart a monthly record of $0.4962. Voyager is settled at a selling price of $0.3598 at the moment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust-wallet-token-twt\">Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</h3>\n<p>As users continue to opt for self-custody in the wake of the FTX collapse, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/twt\">TWT</a> has continued to see a steady price increase. The token attracted gains of 17.92% for a second consecutive week with the week’s top gainers. TWT touched an all-time high of $2.71 but has since retreated to sit at $2.20 following an 11.27% jump in the last 24 hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-losers-sol-suffer-from-ftx-contagio-dydx-joins-in\">Top Losers: SOL Suffer From FTX Contagio, DYDX Joins In</h2>\n<h3 id=\"ftx-token-ftt\">FTX Token (FTT)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ftx-token\">FTT</a> is plunging to new lows as the token continues to dump following parent platform FTX’s downfall. The bankrupt exchange is taking hits from regulators and other entities amidst its ongoing scandal. Its native currency FTX token recorded a yearly low of $1.24. FTT is currently worth $1.33 following a 5.33% increase over the last day. </p>\n<h3 id=\"chiliz-chz\">Chiliz (CHZ)</h3>\n<p>Sports-based cryptocurrency <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/chiliz\">Chiliz</a> is down over 20% despite expectations of increased activity surrounding the token due to the newly commenced FIFA world cup 2022. CHZ entered the week with a trading value of $0.2259 and began charting bullishly afterward. However, on Sunday the token entered an unanticipated downtrend that led it to a weekly low of $0.1701. CHZ has recovered slightly since then and is worth $0.1851 at press time. </p>\n<h3 id=\"dydx-dydx\">dYdX (DYDX)</h3>\n<p>Despite leading the previous week’s top performers, the native currency for DEX dYdX bled out 19.65% of its value earning a spot with the losers. The token was trading in the green at the start of the week but began dumping not long after. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dydx\">DYDX</a>’s negative movement has placed it firmly in bear territory with a current valuation of $1.89.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uniswap-uni\">Uniswap (UNI)</h3>\n<p>Uniswap’s <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/uniswap\">UNI</a> token shed 9.48% of its value over the past 7 days. The token like many others suffered from the market volatility of the past two weeks. UNI spent the week trading in the red dipping to a low of $4.98 on Tuesday.

The token recorded losses of 22.19% over the past 7 days and hit a yearly low of $11.01 due to the bearish movement. However, SOL is currently on the rise, accruing major gains in the past 24 hours.
