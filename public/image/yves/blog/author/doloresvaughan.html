Even as a newbie in the blockchain space, chances are you’ve heard about the Solana ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The network touts itself as the most performant permissionless blockchain globally, but with the crypto industry’s growth, it can be hard to keep up with all the new developments. Let’s explore Solana’s ins and outs and its evolution from its inception in 2017 up to 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-solana\">What is Solana?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-solana-blockchain\">Introducing the Solana Blockchain</h3>\n<p><strong>Solana</strong> is a blockchain platform that is designed to host decentralized and scalable applications. It is an open-source network, which means that developers can build and launch their own decentralized applications using it. Solana initially emerged as a rival to the Ethereum (<a href=\"link\">ETH</a>) blockchain. Like the latter, it offers smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s other core features include its high speed, with the potential to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, and low transaction costs averaging at $0.00025. Transaction fees on Solana are in the network’s native token, <a href=\"link\">SOL</a>.</p>\n<p>The Solana coin is a utility token that functions as a medium of exchange and helps prop up security on the platform via staking. The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former executive at Qualcomm, in 2017 and is currently run by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-solana\">A brief history of Solana</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-and-why-solana-was-created\">How and why Solana was created</h3>\n<p>Solana emerged in response to the scalability limitations of existing blockchain platforms such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BTC</a>) and Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Bitcoin price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believed that agreement on time was one of the biggest challenges of a distributed model.</p>\n<p>Yakovenko recognized that a reliable and accurate clock was crucial for network synchronization. As such, he began working on and developed the concept of <a href=\"link\">proof of history</a>. This technique allows for keeping time between untrusted computers, making network synchronization simpler and faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-exactly-is-solanas-proof-of-history\">What exactly is Solana’s proof of history?</h3>\n<p>The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism is Solana’s chosen technique to keep the time between computers that do not trust each other. The basic idea behind PoH is to use a &quot;timestamp&quot; that is generated by a central server and broadcast to all nodes on the network. This timestamp serves as a reference point for the network, allowing all nodes to agree on the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_26_18_PM_b5d4d80061.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.26.18 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"link\">Medium</a> </p>\n<p>To generate the timestamp, the central server creates a &quot;hash&quot; of a large amount of data (known as a &quot;PoH generator&quot;) and publishes it to the network. Each node on the network can then use this hash to verify the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p>The PoH generator is designed to be computationally expensive to create, ensuring it can only be generated by a central server and not by any individual node on the network. This helps to prevent any one node from manipulating the timestamp or the sequence of events.</p>\n<p>By using the PoH mechanism, Solana can achieve high levels of network synchronization and scalability, allowing it to process a large number of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement over other blockchain systems that lack a reliable clock and struggle to scale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-journey-to-the-solana-launch-yakovenkos-path\">The journey to the Solana launch: Yakovenko’s path</h3>\n<p>Solana was technically created in November 2017 when Anatoly Yakovenko published the whitepaper for the proof-of-history concept. This technique would serve as the foundation for the Solana project. With plans to weave all the world&#39;s transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called it Loom.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald <a href=\"link\">published</a> the first open-source implementation of the PoH technique on GitHub under the name Silk. The project quickly gained traction, and the team continued to develop it.</p>\n<p>By March 2018, the team rebranded the project as Solana, a nod to the small beach town where Yakovenko and his team lived and worked. In June of that same year, they had scaled the technology to run on cloud-based networks. The next month, they published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>After months of testing and development, the Solana mainnet went live on March 31, 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-price-evolution\">Solana price evolution</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-is-solana-worth\">How much is Solana worth?</h3>\n<p>Solana’s SOL token, like most cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price fluctuations. In the first few months after the launch, the Solana price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1.00.</p>\n<p>However, in late 2020, the price of Solana began to rise rapidly. Driven by the non-fungible token (NFT) hype and the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. SOL more than tripled to a peak of $18.00 in early 2021. Solana reached its all-time high of $258 in November 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_40_45_PM_ff2553a118.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.40.45 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Solana price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these gains were nearly wiped out by the end of last year due to the crypto crash and subsequent contagion. Solana’s price took a hard hit from FTX’s implosion due to its close association with the exchange and subsidiaries. SOL dropped under $10 in late December for the first time since February 2021. However, it has recovered in the past month to trade at $24.22 currently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-solana-coins-are-there\">How many Solana coins are there?</h3>\n<p>The Solana foundation revealed that the total number of Solana (SOL) coins to enter circulation is 489 million. At the moment, 260 million tokens are available on the market. </p>\n<h3 id=\"where-can-you-buy-solana\">Where can you buy Solana?</h3>\n<p>Solana (SOL) can be purchased on a variety of exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and <a href=\"link\">ChangeNow</a>. With a user-friendly interface and a wide variety of payment options, ChangeNow makes it easy for anyone to purchase SOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanas-major-developments\">Solana’s major developments</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2019\">Solana’s 2019</h3>\n<p>Right before the Solana mainnet launch, much of the team’s attention was on obtaining funding to develop its new crypto network. The project had already begun to gain traction.</p>\n<p>As such, the team was able to raise $20 million in a private token sale led by Multicoin Capital in Q1 2019. Other participants were Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2020\">Solana’s 2020</h3>\n<p>The year 2020 marked Solana’s emergence as the first blockchain to use proof of history. The platform launched on Mainnet Beta in March 2020, following successful fundraising and the launch of their public test network, Tour de SOL.</p>\n<p>That same year, <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href=\"link\">USDT</a>) launched Solana-native <strong>USDT</strong> and Circle partnered to make <strong><a href=\"link\">USDC</a></strong> a native stablecoin on the platform. Solana also held its first hackathon from October 28 to November 14.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Tether price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2021\">Solana’s 2021</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s 2020 hackathon and subsequent ones were a success, leading to an influx of developers and projects onto the platform. By December 2021, Solana had exceeded 1,000 projects and saw a significant rise in its price and daily active users. This propelled the SOL token to the fifth spot on the crypto list, surpassing <strong>Cardano</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<p>However, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for 17 hours. The platform had formerly gone down for 6 hours in December 2021, earning it a reputation for frequent outages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Cardano price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2022\">Solana’s 2022</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s outage problem persisted into 2022. Despite this, the network was able to make some progress. Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, announced integration with Ethereum and Polygon. In June, Solana revealed plans for the first crypto smartphone, the Solana Saga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/solana_saga_01_7aaaabbbc6.jpg\" alt=\"solana-saga_01.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>The platform also opened a physical store in New York City dedicated to all things crypto in July. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Solana_just_launched_a_physical_store_in_metaverse_79dcec4278.jpg\" alt=\"Solana-just-launched-a-physical-store-in-metaverse.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>Notably, Solana&#39;s NFT market experienced substantial growth in 2022, with the number of minted NFTs reaching 312,000 on September 7. Additionally, Solana NFT trading volumes rose to hit $11.5 million on September 6.</p>\n<p>However, in August, the platform&#39;s mobile wallet suffered a hack resulting in $8 million worth of losses. Thousands of Solana users suffered in the attack, which Solana ultimately blamed on a third-party platform, the Slope mobile wallet app. Solana experienced more losses later on as the FTX and Alameda saga caused the single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics as SOL dipped 96%. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solana-ecosystem\">The Solana ecosystem</h3>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem is home to a diverse range of projects, from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The platform’s speed, affordability, and scalability mean it is quickly becoming a go-to destination for developers, entrepreneurs, and users who want to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications and services. </p>\n<p>Among these projects are <strong>Phantom</strong>, a decentralized social network that empowers users to share content, earn rewards, and connect with others; <strong>Stepn</strong> (<a href=\"link\">GMT</a>), a platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows artists and creators to monetize their work. Solana also hosts <strong>Star Atlas</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ATLAS</a>), a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading digital assets, and <strong>Audius</strong>, initially built on Ethereum but moved to Solana in 2020, a decentralized streaming platform for musicians that enables them to control their music and earn royalties directly from fans.</p>\n<p>More recently, <strong>BONK</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BONK</a>),  “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people,” which was released in December 2020. </p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Like most other projects in the crypto industry, Solana reaped the benefits of 2021’s DeFi and NFT boom. In the same vein, it was unable to escape the impact of the crypto winter in 2022. Still, its attractive blend of speed and affordability, thanks to its unique technology, makes it a staple for most developers in this space. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest SOL trading pairs <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Also Read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/analyst-predicts-sols-price-prior-to-solanas-milestone-conference\">Analyst Predicts SOL’s Price Prior to Solana’s Conference</a></li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-26T19:28:00.275Z","createdAt":"2023-01-26T18:47:45.949Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-02T10:18:16.163Z"},{"id":1366,"title":"ChangeNOW stands against fraudulent actions amid Alameda wallets' suspicious activity","description":"Taking into account the company's high AML standards in terms of resistance to illegal activity, ChangeNOW is putting serious effort into preventing such incidents as the recent Alameda wallets’ case.","slug":"changenow-stands-against-fraudulent-actions-ensures-high-compliance-standards-amid-alameda-wallets-suspicious-activity","metaTitle":"ChangeNOW position amid Alameda suspicious activity","metaDescription":"The compliance team works round-the-clock with investigation inquiries related to Alameda funds movement","featuredImage":{"id":6782,"name":"12.28 Alameda Incident Statement-01.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Once fraudulent activity was first reported by investigators, the ChangeNOW compliance team responded immediately and blocklisted suspicious wallets.

On the contrary, ETH value declined to a local minimum: it lost 19% from the pre-Merge peak, although has almost recovered later as the crypto market entered a <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/why-is-crypto-going-up\">new rally</a>. The echoing on-chain activity to the price decline was a massive ETH <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-whale-and-shark-addresses-offload-as-eth-price-struggles/\">dump</a>: whales have sold over $4 billion worth of ETH over the last few weeks. </p>\n<p>This pattern corresponds to the old rule: ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’. The Merge had been widely discussed long before it happened, so the market has already had a chance to react. No one really was expecting a surge. </p>\n<p>Moreover, the Merge is likely to have a primarily long-term effect on ETH price. The update has laid the ground for scaling updates that will reduce fees and increase throughput in Ethereum across 2023-2024, making it a backbone of web3. </p>\n<p>Deflation is going to do a part of the job, too. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-deflation-burned-gas-fees-plus-lowered-rewards\">Ethereum deflation: burned gas fees plus lowered rewards</h3>\n<p>In Ethereum, the supply is determined by how much ETH is issued and burned. The way to cut the supply (and push the price up) is to issue less coins and burn more. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Issue less.</strong> Prior to the Merge, miners received about 13,000 ETH in rewards daily, and stakers got 1,600 ETH. <strong>Ethereum inflation rate was about 4.62%</strong>. After mining was abandoned, ETH emission dropped by 90%. </li>\n<li><strong>Burn more.</strong> Throughout most of Ethereum’s history, barely any coins were burned. In 2021, the London hard fork changed this – since it was adopted, ETH gas fees have been burned depending on the network load. This gave Ethereum the means to reduce supply – and make it deflationary. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>As of October 27, Ethereum inflation rate was <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">as low as</a> 0.009%</strong> in annual terms – Ethereum supply has increased only by approx. 1,200 coins since the Merge. If the update were not to happen, the supply would grow by about 500,000 ETH, and the inflation would hit 3.6%.  </p>\n<p><strong>Coin burns and reduced rewards have cut Ethereum inflation down almost to zero.</strong> This is certainly a long-term bullish sign for ETH price. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_27_T125825_600_1a89f59b53.png\" alt=\"eth coin burns\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">Image source</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-faces-problems-following-the-merge\">Ethereum Faces Problems Following the Merge</h2>\n<h3 id=\"centralization\">Centralization</h3>\n<p>During the first post-Merge hours, Ethereum was caught on high centralization rates – however, the first signs of this were present even before the update. </p>\n<p>In September 2022, a blockchain analytics firm Nansen <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/64-of-staked-eth-controlled-by-five-entities-nansen\">calculated</a> that 61.25% of all staked Ethereum is spread across just 4 platforms. The combined share of 3 centralized exchanges – Coinbase, Kraken и Binance – exceeded 30%. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_27_T125628_565_b6fc582cd6.png\" alt=\"eth stakers entities\" ></p>\n<p>September data by Nansen. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/64-of-staked-eth-controlled-by-five-entities-nansen\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>This is how the Merge makes Ethereum more vulnerable to censorship. Centralized exchanges must comply with the state sanctions policy and may ban transactions. Decentralized Lido protocol (holds 31% of staked ETH) shows high levels of governance token concentration – and also carries censorship risk. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJaCaS0WbIw\">acknowledged</a> these issues at a developers’ call back in August. </p>\n<p>According to Santiment market intelligence platform, 46% of Ethereum blocks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1570339602346684416\">were added</a> to the blockchain by just two addresses on the first post-Merge day. “This heavy dominance by these addresses is something to watch,” said company analysts.</p>\n<p>And the fears were not unreasonable. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mev-boost-censorship-and-ofac-compliance\">MEV-boost censorship and OFAC compliance</h3>\n<p>As of October 16, 2022, the U.S. government censors over a half of Ethereum blocks. How’s this possible, and what does it have to do with MEV – Ethereum’s “invisible tax”?</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-mev-boost-block-relayers\">What are MEV-boost block relayers?</h3>\n<p>MEV, or Maximum Extractable Value, allows Ethereum validators to raise their profit by manipulating the order of transactions. Although MEV helps fix market inefficiencies, it increases gas costs for all users. Almost $700 million of “invisible tax” have been <a href=\"https://explore.flashbots.net/\">extracted</a> since 2020. </p>\n<p>To reduce the impact of MEV, a centralized research organization Flashbots created a mechanism that democratizes access to MEV profits. It separates block creation and validation: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is an open market of <strong>block builders</strong> who make up profitable combinations of transactions, </li>\n<li>These transaction bundles are verified by <strong>block relayers</strong>, </li>\n<li>Relayers pass these blocks to <strong>validators</strong>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>MEV-boost</strong> is an iteration of this mechanism suitable for post-Merge Ethereum. Flashbots has made its code open-source so that other organizations could develop their own MEV relays. </p>\n<p>However, this quest for decentralization has gone wrong. </p>\n<h3 id=\"most-relays-are-controlled-by-the-government\">Most relays are controlled by the government</h3>\n<p>According to the MEV-boost <a href=\"https://www.mevboost.org/\">tracker</a>, over 81% of MEV-enabled blocks are relayed by Flashbots themselves. Moreover, Flashbots dashboard <a href=\"https://transparency.flashbots.net/\">shows</a> that the <strong>organization relays 58% of all Ethereum blocks</strong> (not only those using MEV-boost), compared to 12% on September 15, the first post-Merge day. </p>\n<p>This dependency raises concerns about a single point of failure in the Ethereum ecosystem – but even more importantly, provides the basis for censorship. Research shows that <strong>Flashbots <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/going-ethereum-mev-boost-113000487.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHueRjOvH8IEnf0vdExmVxpfwV7vv7T-Li0pjkOFrX8WV7bWzvu5CYL6Ga5TuZUPz8w2ligZWFSTMPkpwroDDwKguS57QGNXTji0pwsmhusoYYEw9j4lZ6VCZKpsRgZPVnXYj2nj-x7aprX8nad38Kh2-KJuKSiAOJ4rmAwgdU2O\">have censored</a> transactions from Tornado Cash</strong>, a mixing service blacklisted by the OFAC – an agency responsible for U.S. economic sanctions. Tornado Cash has been widely used for money laundering, but many industry players perceived its ban as severe pressure on the crypto market. </p>\n<p>Here’s the root of the problem: <strong>MEV-boost relays are centralized businesses that must implement sanctions</strong> by the law. According to the <a href=\"https://www.mevwatch.info/\">MEV Watch</a> portal, <strong>64% of all Ethereum blocks are OFAC-compliant</strong>. Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis infrastructure platform, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1580893089077809153\">warns</a>: <em>“if the censoring validators would now stop attesting to non-censoring blocks, they would eventually form the canonical, 100% censoring chain.”</em></p>\n<p>For truth’s sake, Köppelmann <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1570445314456264704\">said the same</a> about the first cryptocurrency: _“No, dear Bitcoin fans, it is not better in Bitcoin. In fact you need only 4 entities to come to &gt;72%.” _It’s not correct to directly compare Bitcoin mining pools and major Ethereum stakers, though: pools are made up of independent individual miners, while stakers like Binance or Coinbase act as centralized entities. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_27_T125713_549_36a3c0ae77.png\" alt=\"eth post-merge\" ></p>\n<p>Percentage of OFAC-compliant blocks. <a href=\"https://www.mevwatch.info/\">Image source </a></p>\n<h3 id=\"its-hard-to-set-up-solo-staking\">It’s hard to set up solo staking</h3>\n<p>As Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake, users <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/xtn5ll/unpopular_opinion_staking_is_too_difficult_for/\">found</a> it difficult to start staking ETH on their own node. A user who raised this issue on Reddit had spent a weekend debugging the validator node, given that he was quite tech-savvy. <em>&quot;Staking is too difficult for common folk to do,”</em> he said – and this may hinder Ethereum’s decentralization. </p>\n<p>Some users argued in response that “staking is work, too” and requires time, just as mining did. But technical difficulty isn’t the only problem with Ethereum staking – 32 ETH (~$49,600) is quite a high entry threshold. </p>\n<p>Reddit users pointed out that these obstacles push users to centralized services like Binance and Coinbase – which poses risks discussed above. </p>\n<h2 id=\"did-ethereum-become-eco-friendly-after-merge\">Did Ethereum Become Eco-Friendly After Merge?</h2>\n<p>Before the Merge, Ethereum <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/climate-neutral-cryptos-vs-bitcoin-how-green-is-the-future\">produced</a> 12 million tons of CO2 annually and 27 kg per transaction. Vitalik Buterin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1570299062800510976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1570299062800510976%7Ctwgr%5E030fac3ab0356057bcde92904859e7d0be705dfe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F09%2F15%2Fvitalik-buterin-says-ethereum-merge-cut-global-energy-usage-by-02-one-of-biggest-decarbonization-events-ever%2F\">expected</a> that the update would reduce global energy consumption by 0.2%. </p>\n<p>On September 15, Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute released a report: the network slashed electricity usage even more than expected. Ethereum’s energy needs and carbon footprint both dropped by 99.99%, compared to 99.95% as forecasted by the Ethereum foundation. The post-Merge blockchain is expected to generate only 870 kilograms of CO2 per year – less than the average 100 American households. </p>\n<p>There is, however, one important caveat to this data. Hashrate of some Proof of Work chains has increased after the Merge, so at least part of the Ethereum miners switched to <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum-pow\">EthereumPoW</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum-classic\">Ethereum Classic</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ravencoin\">Ravencoin</a>, and Ergo. In the meantime, the possibility to use original Ethereum rigs to mine other coins is limited, and many enthusiasts have abandoned mining after the Merge. </p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-up-with-ethereumpow\">What’s Up with EthereumPoW?</h2>\n<p>As the Merge loomed, a defiant group of miners <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/the-merge-explained-one-step-closer-to-scalable-ethereum\">claimed</a> they would continue mining original Ethereum under the name EthereumPoW. Experts called the fork unviable, and the chain has had quite a bit of <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/ethw-exchanges-available-on-changenow\">trouble</a> while trying to launch. </p>\n<p>Weeks after the Merge, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum-pow\">ETHW</a> blockchain is operating. The coin is trading at $7 – it’s a 86% loss from its $49.5 peak on September 15 and a 96% drop compared to the ETHW announcement date. The network’s hashrate is about 32 TH/s – the original Ethereum had 900 TH/s one week prior to the Merge.</p>\n<p>EthereumPoW’s TVL is only <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/EthereumPoW\">$6.7 million</a>, no original Ethereum DeFi or gaming protocols have ever emerged in its ecosystem. An example of a ETHW-based project is the <a href=\"https://uniwswap.com\">UniWswap</a> DEX.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-stop-scalable-ethereum\">Next Stop: Scalable Ethereum</h2>\n<p>When the Merge went live, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1570312017520762881\">said</a> that the update was overhyped. <em>“You do understand that nothing has changed in terms of performance, operating cost, nor liquidity?”,</em> he uttered and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1574251563412992000\">criticized</a> Ethereum for not looking into Cardano’s Ouroboros. In fact, the recent Vasil update in the ADA network has instantly <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/vasil-hard-fork-explained-what-changes-for-cardano\">increased</a> Cardano performance and reduced fees. Then, what was Hoskinson missing?</p>\n<p>The Merge has laid the ground for the next Ethereum update known as the Surge, scheduled to happen sometime in 2023. It will introduce <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/the-merge-explained-one-step-closer-to-scalable-ethereum\">sharding</a>, allowing the blockchain to process up to 100,000 transactions per second. Unlike Cardano, Ethereum was co-founded by Hoskinson as a Proof of Work blockchain, so it needs a while to implement all of the fundamental changes. </p>\n<p>The bold transition to Proof of Stake has set an example for the entire industry. Vitalik Buterin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1573357374299160578\">expressed</a> hope that as this consensus algorithm matures, more PoW chains will leverage it in the future. And there’s already a hint this may come true – ZCash and Dogecoin have announced looking into the possibility of migrating to PoS. Highly efficient and sustainable crypto industry may be closer than we think it is. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-10-27T11:31:22.583Z","createdAt":"2022-10-27T11:31:20.843Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-27T11:31:22.600Z"},{"id":1322,"title":"Why is crypto going up?","description":"Cryptocurrency is pumping presumably due to the UK crypto regulation news.

Named after a small Southern Californian coastal city, Solana was designed to work similarly to and improve upon <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/ethereum-basics-eth-20-and-forks-explained\">Ethereum</a>.</p>\n<p>Solana uses an innovative hybrid consensus model that combines a unique <a href=\"https://anycoindirect.eu/en/blog/what-is-proof-of-history\">proof-of-history</a> (PoH) algorithm with underlying <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp\">proof-of-stake</a> (PoS). PoS allows validators to verify transactions based on how many coins or tokens they hold, while PoH uses timestamps to verify transactions very quickly.</p>\n<p>Solana solves all three issues of the blockchain trilemma concerning scalability, security, and decentralization. Its architecture allows for a theoretical upper limit of 710.000 transactions per second on a standard gigabit network and 28.4 million transactions on a 40-gigabit network.</p>\n<p>Solana is a popular fast-growing blockchain which has unique advantages, so it is often referred to as an “Ethereum killer” in the &quot;Solana vs Ethereum&quot; scramble.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-solana-work\">How Does Solana Work?</h2>\n<p>Solana processes lots of transactions quickly using its unique combination of protocols. The scalability improvement is achieved by implementing the proof-of-history consensus in combination with the basic proof-of-stake consensus of the blockchain. Thanks to the innovative model, Solana attracts the attention of both small traders and institutional traders.</p>\n<p>Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance at Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, points out that trying to process transactions quickly usually requires centralization. For example, Visa needs to use a huge network of computers to keep its processing speed on track. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, on the other hand, processes transactions relatively slowly to remain decentralized.</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s objective is to process transactions at speeds comparable to large centralized companies like Visa and keep being decentralized herewith. Such speed allows the protocol to handle more transactions, which implies scalability because more users can use the chain simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The need for additional security levels is due to the speed with which blocks are added to the Solana blockchain. Solana’s proof-of-history algorithm timestamps each block in a way that maintains the system’s security.</p>\n<p>Solana’s native token is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/solana\">SOL</a>, it is used to pay transaction fees on the network, or stake to earn additional rewards. The system can also perform micropayments called &quot;lamports&quot; that are named in honor of Leslie Lamport, an American computer scientist and mathematician best known for work in distributed systems. </p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-proof-of-history-concept\">Solana Proof-of-History Concept</h2>\n<p>The proof-of-history concept is described in a <a href=\"https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf\">white paper</a> published by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko in November 2017. The main thought is that publicly available blockchains don&#39;t rely on time, with each node in the network relying on its own local clock without knowledge of any other participants&#39; clocks in the network.</p>\n<p>The lack of a trusted source of time (i.e. a standardized clock) means that when a message timestamp is used to accept or reject a message, there is no guarantee that the same choice will be made by other participants in the network.</p>\n<p>PoH gets past this obstacle, with every node in the network able to rely on the recorded passage of time in the ledger on the trustless basis that is key to blockchain functioning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-solana-used-for\">What is Solana Used For?</h2>\n<p>Solana is a network where projects can be created using advantages of scalability and flexibility. Here are just some of the use cases for Solana blockchain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defi-and-dex\">DeFi and DEX</h3>\n<p>Solana is the backbone of stablecoins like Saber that give users an option of cross-cryptocurrency trading. Saber brings vital liquidity to Solana helping facilitate the transfer of assets between Solana and other dApp platforms. As for DEX, there’s the Serum swap platform that brings benefits of a centralized exchange to the DeFi space. It is one of the only DEXes in the crypto space that attracts traders who prefer the user experience of centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lending-protocols\">Lending Protocols</h3>\n<p>Developers have created <a href=\"https://apricot.one/\">Apricot Finance</a> and <a href=\"https://solend.fi/\">Solend</a> systems that allow users to deposit or lend currencies, earn interest or configure automated repayments over the Solana blockchain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nft-apps-and-marketplaces\">NFT apps and marketplaces</h3>\n<p>Solana is used to create NFT applications that allow users to generate and trade digital artwork. Users can create their own NFT storefronts and tools to generate them, integrate products into other applications on <a href=\"https://www.metaplex.com/\">Metaplex</a> and <a href=\"https://solanart.io/\">Solanart</a> marketplaces.</p>\n<h3 id=\"games\">Games</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Solana, players can earn crypto and NFTs by playing games that have Play-to-earn   (P2E) systems. These are multiplayer worlds like <a href=\"https://chainers.io/\">Chainers</a> and <a href=\"https://aurory.io/\">Aurory</a> or survival-puzzle games like <a href=\"https://nagakingdom.com/\">Naga Kingdom</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web3-apps\">Web3 Apps</h3>\n<p>One of the most exciting developments over the Solana blockchain is apps like <a href=\"https://blockdaemon.com/\">Blockdaemon</a> and <a href=\"https://buildspace.so/\">Buildspace</a>, which take advantage of the Web3 infrastructure . </p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-vs-ethereum\">Solana vs Ethereum</h2>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem expands rapidly and gets more popular, inevitably being compared to Ethereum, the leading blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps).

Its NFT marketplace gives buyers an opportunity to make faster transactions at much lower cost.</li>\n<li>Solana’s computing processes are much more environmentally-friendly than, for example, Bitcoin mining, which currently produces a carbon footprint equivalent to what is produced by the entire country of Greece. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"cons\">Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Solana network only has 1,000 validators to date, which questions if its nature can be considered truly deсentralized.</li>\n<li>Hardware requirements and ongoing maintenance costs (~40,000-95,000 USD per year) create a high barrier to becoming a validator.</li>\n<li>Solana has only 350 projects on its network – there is definitely space for growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"is-solana-a-good-investment\">Is Solana a Good Investment?</h2>\n<p>Solana does not have a hard cap on the total number of coins issued. It started to increase its supply by 8% yearly. Expected inflation rate will decline until it reaches 1.5%, where it will remain indefinitely. Crypto investors seeking zero inflation should take that into consideration . </p>\n<p>On the other hand, Solana is attractive to many investors because of its innovative achievement. Its potential throughput is 65.000 transactions per second with almost zero fees and focus on taking care of the environment.</p>\n<p>Main crypto networks have a big number of active projects.

Is interoperability between all chains possible, and does it involve a seamless transfer of tokens from one blockchain to the other?</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://cosmos.network/\">Cosmos</a></strong> is a project that has developed a communication protocol where all this is possible. You can get the best out of different chains and combine those features under one roof. In this review, we will see what Cosmos is, what the developers have created, and what are the capabilities of this ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-cosmos-atom\">About Cosmos (ATOM)</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_06_ATOM_review_e4f247db92.png\" alt=\"Cosmos Coin Review 2022\" ></p>\n<p>The project was born in 2014 and was developed by a US company called <strong>All in Bits Inc</strong>. A Swiss non-profit organization, <strong>Interchain Foundation</strong>, oversees and coordinates the development and works closely with a long list of other companies dedicated to the prosperity of Cosmos.  </p>\n<p>In 2017, Cosmos held a series of ICOs where they collected over $17 million. It took nearly two years for the team to activate the mainnet, which was launched in March 2019. The native token of the network is called <strong>ATOM</strong>, and it serves multiple roles in the Cosmos ecosystem.  </p>\n<p>This project refers to itself as the internet of all blockchains. It envisions a decentralized world with interconnected applications and services enabling a simple exchange of data and value among its community members. Cosmos is scalable, highly customizable, and secure.</p>\n<p>Those are some of the reasons why <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/intro/\">hundreds of apps and services</a> rely on the Cosmos blockchain daily and why over $60 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets are stored on its connected chains.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*tQJmFZPVy5rpMtB1\" alt=\"Image source\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Monetary value is shared among those who create it. It isn’t hoarded by a few centralized entities, which is often the case with traditional platforms. The interoperability features enable programmers to build independent chains that can connect to all other network participants but maintain their own rules and consensus. That makes Cosmos an attractive development platform for gaming, NFTs, DeFi, exchanges, and various autonomous organizations. </p>\n<p>The network allows for custom rulesets and voting on community decisions. You have the freedom to share your ideas and monetize them without being censored by a central authority. Lastly, marketplaces can be built that enable permissionless trading, and the network allows users to create their own unique NFTs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cosmos-atom-team\">Cosmos (ATOM) Team</h2>\n<p>Cosmos was co-created by developers and computer scientists <strong>Jae Kwon</strong> and <strong>Ethan</strong> <strong>Buckman</strong>. Ethan is also the President of the Foundation Council of <a href=\"https://interchain.io/about\">The Interchain Foundation (ICF)</a><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">,</span> which supports decentralized technologies.</p>\n<p>The other essential ICF team members include Vice President <strong>Brian</strong> <strong>Crain</strong> and Council Member <strong>Fernando</strong> <strong>Pedone</strong>. <strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Niederer</strong> is the Chief Financial Officer, and dozens of other staff members are responsible for the management, production, marketing, engineering, ecosystem growth, etc. </p>\n<p>Tendermint inc. is a US-based software company that was crucial in the creation of Cosmos. Tendermint has now become <a href=\"https://ignite.com/\">Ignite</a><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">,</span> and its goal is to help developers launch and grow their own decentralized blockchain projects. <strong>Jae</strong> <strong>Kwon</strong> was the Chief Architect and Founder of Tendermint inc. The President and CEO was <strong>Peng</strong> <strong>Zhong</strong>. Besides them, <strong>Heng</strong> <strong>Cao</strong>, <strong>Claire</strong> <strong>Hough</strong>, and <strong>Nick</strong> <strong>Tomaino</strong> occupied the Board of Directors positions.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"cosmos-atom-roadmap\">Cosmos (ATOM) Roadmap</h2>\n<p>The Cosmos team is working on a bunch of upgrades and changes to their network. New partnerships are being formed, which can be followed by their social media announcements and press releases. Let’s see what’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0LT42PgKxI\">in the works for the near future</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cosmos now features <strong>Interchain Accounts</strong>, which work on other blockchains that are part of the ecosystem through a single wallet. You will be able to secure all your crypto through the same account. </li>\n<li>The Cosmos-based <strong>Gravity DEX</strong> has been migrated to its own chain, the <strong>Crescent Network,</strong> to prevent exchange activity from causing congestion on the Cosmos Hub.</li>\n<li>Ethereum’s biggest decentralized exchange, <strong>dYdX,</strong> has announced they are switching to a Cosmos-based blockchain, which should go live by the end of 2022. This upgrade should allow the DEX to increase its throughput to 1000s of transactions per second.</li>\n<li>Cosmos developers are working with teams from Polkadot and Ethereum to integrate the two chains.</li>\n<li>A security upgrade is being prepared that will enable Cosmos validators to secure other blockchains, both Cosmos-based and not. Enterprises and private companies could then utilize those network’s security standards on their own chains. The launch date for this new feature is planned for January 2023. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://hub.cosmos.network/main/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.html\">Other planned updates</a> include the <strong>Rho Upgrade</strong> scheduled for the second half of 2022. It is supposed to make changes to governance and transaction fees, among other things. The <strong>Lambda Upgrade</strong> is expected in Q1 of 2023, focusing on security and staking. The last two roadmap entries are <strong>Epsilon</strong> (Q2 of 2023) and <strong>Gamma</strong> (Q3 of 2023). The Cosmos team will also work on improving privacy and scalability, NFT support, and more advanced smart contract functionalities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cosmos-atom-network\">Cosmos (ATOM) Network</h2>\n<p>Cosmos is an eco-friendly <strong>Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong> type of coin that utilizes a consensus algorithm called <strong>Tendermint</strong>. Both Cosmos and Tendermint were created by the same person, the developer Jae Kwon.** **The network’s core features include scalability of up to 10.000 transactions per second and top-notch security.</p>\n<p>Cosmos has its own software development toolkit called <strong>Cosmos SDK</strong>. It allows developers to build unique blockchains and dApps. Several popular projects were built using the Cosmos SDK, including names such as Binance Coin, Cronos, Thorchain, Luna, etc. There are currently over 260 decentralized apps, blockchains, wallets, and other services that make up <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps\">the Cosmos ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<p>Communication and interoperability between different chains are possible thanks to the <strong>Inter Blockchain Communication protocol</strong> known as <strong>IBC</strong>. No matter what consensus algorithms the different networks use, they will be able to transfer tokens using the IBC. This communications protocol can be used both by PoW and PoS coins, provided the blockchains feature a fast transaction finality.</p>\n<p>The network is also called <strong>Cosmos Hub,</strong> and it reaches a consensus if 2/3 of all validators agree on the validity of a proposed block. Delegators can select which validators will maintain consensus, and those block producers will then add new blocks to the Cosmos blockchain. The Cosmos Hub is currently limited to 175 validators.</p>\n<p>In terms of numbers, moving digital assets through the network costs <strong>$0.01</strong> on average. Transaction confirmation is fast and takes about <strong>7 seconds</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-gravity-dex-and-gravity-bridge\">The Gravity DEX and Gravity Bridge</h3>\n<p>Cosmos has a decentralized exchange called the <strong><a href=\"https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/\">Gravity DEX</a></strong>. It’s a liquidity provider and automated market maker that brought cross-chain DeFi to the ecosystem. The DEX allows users to swap different network tokens and trade in a decentralized fashion. </p>\n<p>Gravity Dex is a price-efficient solution because of its use of batched transactions. This method lowers trading fees to an average of $0.08 per swap.     </p>\n<p>Cosmos developers are also working on the <strong>Gravity Bridge</strong>. It will be secured by billions of dollars worth of staked ATOM tokens and represent a two-way connection hub to Ethereum. Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens can migrate into Cosmos, and native Cosmos tokens can go the other way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-cosmos-atom\">How to Mine Cosmos (ATOM)</h2>\n<p>Staking helps to make the Cosmos Hub better and safer for all network participants. ATOM tokens can be staked to earn rewards. This activity also allows stakeholders to participate in governance by voting on proposals about the project&#39;s future.  </p>\n<p>Network participants can either be delegators or validators. <a href=\"https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/cosmos/\">The staking rewards</a> for delegating the ATOM coin are currently between <strong>17% <strong>and</strong> 18%.</strong> Running your own validator node brings APR rewards of over <strong>19%</strong>. </p>\n<p>There is no minimum token requirement for delegators, while validator nodes need a stake of at least <strong>67.500 ATOMs</strong>. Staked tokens have a lock-up period of 21 days, during which they remain inaccessible to the holders. Malicious behavior and/or consensus infringements can result in having parts of your stake slashed. </p>\n<h2 id=\"atom-coin-price-prediction-for-2022\">ATOM Coin Price Prediction For 2022</h2>\n<p>ATOM’s price has been bouncing from $12 to $16 in September 2022. Let’s see what two independent market experts believe will happen to the Cosmos coin in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"coin-price-forecast\">Coin Price Forecast</h3>\n<p>The technical analysts from <strong><a href=\"https://coinpriceforecast.com/cosmos\">Coin Price Forecast</a></strong> have published their views on the Cosmos ATOM crypto. They don’t expect significant movements during 2022 and predict a year-end valuation of around $20 a coin.</p>\n<p>In 2023, ATOM looks set to go above the $20 mark before the asset breaches the $25 threshold in 2025. If their predictions are correct, 2027 is the year where the token could trade for over $31 a unit.</p>\n<p>A +200% value increase from today’s prices is predicted in 2030, when ATOM should be trading at over $43 on exchanges. A slight reversal is expected in the years that follow before the coin reaches its all-time high in 2033 at $44. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-economy-forecast-agency\">The Economy Forecast Agency</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://longforecast.com/cosmos\">The Economy Forecast Agency</a></strong> has released its long-term report on ATOM until 2026. According to them, Cosmos could end 2022 worth over $22. They don’t believe 2023 will be a good year for this digital asset because expectations show a bearish trend, with trading taking place between $11 and $18. </p>\n<p>Luckily, such a sentiment won’t last long, and 2024 is predicted to entail a price jump from $11 to $28. More positivity is expected in 2025, with further value increases to nearly $35 a coin. Technical analysis shows that ATOM could begin a downtrend in the second half of 2025. The bottom is believed to be close to $21. Most of 2026 is bullish, with an ATH reported to be coming in June at over $41 per token.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-buy-and-store-atom\">Where To Buy and Store ATOM</h2>\n<p>Cosmos is a vast ecosystem made up of various apps and services. As such, there are plenty of wallets and exchanges where the ATOM token can be purchased and stored. Let’s name the most popular ones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cosmos-wallets\">Cosmos Wallets</h3>\n<p>The official website of the Cosmos Network links to 33 different brands that support the ATOM token. </p>\n<p>This digital asset can be securely stored in the easy-to-use<a href=\"https://walletnow.app/cosmos-wallet\"> NOW Wallet</a>. NOW Wallet is a non-custodial service with round-the-clock customer support and options to buy Cosmos with a debit or credit card. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/image_1_bdcd2b47ce.png\" alt=\"image-1.png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Keplr wallet</strong> is an all-around solution that features asset management, staking and claiming rewards, governance rights, access to dApps, etc. It can be used as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox or as a mobile app for iOS or Android devices. Keplr is a non-custodial wallet that supports Ledger hardware wallets.</p>\n<p>The ATOM token is also natively supported by <strong>Ledger hardware wallets</strong>. These devices can be used for buying, storing, and staking this coin.</p>\n<p>Some other wallets that support the Cosmos token include the likes of <strong>Exodus, Guarda Wallet, Shapeshift, Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet, <strong>and</strong> ImToken</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cosmos-crypto-exchanges\">Cosmos Crypto Exchanges</h3>\n<p>If you want to know how to buy Cosmos in an easy and quick way, you should consider the <strong><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/cosmos\">ChangeNOW</a></strong> instant swaps platform. It supports buying Cosmos with a long list of fiat or cryptocurrencies and using an optional fixed rate. The most prominent assets that are exchanged with ATOM include BTC, ETH, USDT, and many more.</p>\n<p>Apart from ChangeNOW, ATOMs can also be bought on the following crypto exchanges: <strong>Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Bithumb, Gate.io, Huobi Global, Kraken, Coinone</strong>, etc.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2022-10-12T11:46:09.908Z","createdAt":"2022-10-11T12:40:02.279Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-12T11:46:09.930Z"},{"id":1308,"title":"Bitgert (BRISE) Review 2022","description":"Bitgert is a layer-1 network for dApps that has the highest throughput (100,000 TPS) and lowest fees ($0.00000001 per transaction) among all known blockchains.","slug":"bitgert-brise-review-2022","metaTitle":"Bitgert (BRISE) Review 2022","metaDescription":"Bitgert is a layer-1 network for dApps that has the highest throughput (100,000 TPS) and lowest fees ($0.00000001 per transaction) among all known blockchains.","featuredImage":{"id":6159,"name":"09.19 BRISE review.png","alternativeText":"Bitgert (BRISE) Review 2022","caption":"","hash":"09_19_BRISE_review_921d1731d8","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/09_19_BRISE_review_921d1731d8.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_09_19_BRISE_review_921d1731d8.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_09_19_BRISE_review_921d1731d8.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_09_19_BRISE_review_921d1731d8.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_09_19_BRISE_review_921d1731d8.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Initially a BSC-based token, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitgert\">Bitgert</a> has delivered a dedicated blockchain with a great variety of ecosystem products in just a few months.

It is a staking platform and a decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain built as an alternative to PancakeSwap. Bitrise’s native token, BRISE, is a BEP20 asset created to bring rewards to its holders. Besides DeFi features, Bitrise <a href=\"https://bitgert.com/audits/public/\">used to offer</a> auditing services – any platform could get a free smart contract audit in under 48 hours.  </p>\n<p>In December 2021, Bitrise <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bitgertbrise/status/1470648504359919621\">was renamed</a> Bitgert and addressed one of the greatest challenges in the crypto industry – high fees and poor throughput of public blockchains. Although things got better in the past few years (new PoS chains charge a few cents worth of gas and allow for hundreds of transactions per second), ever-evolving segments such as DeFi, NFT, and Web3, still needed more. </p>\n<p>The Bitgert blockchain, or Brise Chain, went live in February 2022. It enables processing 100,000 transactions per second (which is twice as many as Solana does), its block time is 15 seconds, and the gas fee is just $0.00000001 per transaction. The blockchain’s native asset is BRISE, custom tokens are issued in the BRC20 format. </p>\n<p>Bitgert Chain is EVM-compatible – any Ethereum or BSC-based dApp can be easily deployed on this network. Faster transaction finality and near-zero fees have attracted many projects to the Brise Chain, while its numerous ecosystem products facilitate its use – Brise dApp wallet, DEX, Bridge, Exchange, and others. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bitgert-brise-team\">Bitgert (BRISE) Team</h2>\n<p>The Bitgert team is anonymous – it is unknown who has founded the project and who runs it today. In January 2022, the company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bitgertbrise/status/1478416159699439616/photo/1\">tweeted</a> that the developer, project owner and director of Bitgert is Gert Sanem, but “he will stay anonymous for various reasons including the personal well-being of himself & his family.” The tweet also mentioned pseudonymous Dominick Rogers as Manager, Ioakim Smirnov as Chief Marketing Officer, and Slava Alexeeva as Twitter correspondent. </p>\n<p>In another statement one month later, Bitgert removed all the team info and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bitgertbrise/status/1489198495626297347\">stated</a> that the platform will be an “undoxxed project.” The company said they did it “to protect the team and give the ability to move ahead with strength and without fear.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"bitgert-brise-roadmap\">Bitgert (BRISE) Roadmap</h2>\n<p>The official <a href=\"https://bitgert.com/roadmap-2/\">Bitgert roadmap V2</a> is divided into 12 stages spanning from July 2021 to January 2025. Five stages, 2-3 months each, have already been completed as of September 2022. The current one, Stage 06, lasts from August to November 2022, and includes the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitgert will <strong>launch Paybrise dApp</strong> <strong>in beta</strong> – an application that will allow merchants to accept payments in BRISE coin. </li>\n<li>Paybrise will be integrated into the official Brise Wallet. </li>\n<li><strong>Startup Studio</strong>, the platform helping entrepreneurs build their business with Bitgert, <strong>will be expanded.</strong> The company aims to facilitate the launch of 1000+ new projects in the next 12 months, in addition to 30 that already run on the Brise Chain. </li>\n<li>User Interface Wireframe for <strong>Bitgert’s decentralized marketplace</strong> will be developed.</li>\n<li>The company will build <strong>new strategic partnerships</strong> – to ensure listing of BRISE on top exchanges and attract new protocols in its ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Centralized Exchange for Android</strong> will launch in beta. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the upcoming Stage 07 from December 2022 to February 2023, Bitgert plans to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch Paybrise and decentralized marketplace in beta on mainnet. </li>\n<li>Launch CEX on mainnet for Android.</li>\n<li>Work at Web 3.0 Geo Data Mapping Graphics. More details are to be announced. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Between 2023 and 2025, Bitgert plans to launch Web3 geo data map and oracle, decentralized B2C and freelancer marketplaces, and decentralized VPN. When the current roadmap is completed, Roadmap V3 will be introduced. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bitgert-brise-network\">Bitgert (BRISE) Network</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bitgert-on-bsc\">Bitgert on BSC</h3>\n<p>Initially, Bitgert was launched as a <a href=\"https://pancakeswap.finance/info/token/0x8fff93e810a2edaafc326edee51071da9d398e83\">token</a> on Binance Smart Chain. A big part of the liquidity was concentrated in the BRISE/BNB pool on PancakeSwap. The token still runs on BSC, and there is a 12% tax on every Bitgert transaction (buy, sell, and transfer) that includes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>5% buyback – tokens are withheld in the smart contract and then buy out BRISE from the liquidity pool. They are further burned to ensure deflationary pressure on the token.</li>\n<li>4% from every transaction is spread between all BRISE holders as rewards in BNB. Investors simply need to keep Bitgert tokens in their wallets to automatically receive rewards. </li>\n<li>3% tax is charged for marketing purposes. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bitgert-chain\">Bitgert Chain</h3>\n<p>Transactions on the BRC20 blockchain are free from any tax – you only have to pay a $0.00000001 gas fee. BRISE, this chain’s native coin, is used as a P2P payment system inside the Bitgert decentralized wallet. As of the beginning of September, 2022, there have been 118K+ wallet addresses and 1,7M+ transactions made in the Brise chain, according to <a href=\"https://scanbrc.com/\">ScanBRC</a>.</p>\n<p>BRC20 chain is an EVM-compatible blockchain, meaning that any protocol could easily migrate there from Ethereum or BSC. Like the latter, the Brise Chain is secured with the Proof of Authority consensus mechanism – there is an array of authorized nodes that confirm blocks. This solution ensures limited decentralization but allows for short block times and ultra-low fees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bitgert-ecosystem\">Bitgert Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Brise Chain is less than 1 year old, but it already boasts a good adoption rate. The blockchain hosts many protocols, of which most notable are: <a href=\"https://knit.finance/\">Knit Finance</a> cross-chain wrapped assets protocol, <a href=\"https://brise.miidas.com/\">miidas</a> – world’s first NFT marketplace for both digital and physical assets, <a href=\"https://thesphynx.co/\">Sphynx Labs</a> and <a href=\"https://app.icecreamswap.com/\">Icecream Swap</a> decentralized exchanges.</p>\n<p>Here are the <strong>Bitgert ecosystem products</strong>developed by the BRISE team: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://bitgert.com/brise-wallet/\">BRISE dApp Wallet</a></strong>. The native mobile wallet of the Bitgert ecosystem allows users to send, receive, store, and trade tokens on BRC20 Chain and other EVM-compatible networks, including Ethereum and BSC. </li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://bitgert.exchange/\">Centralized exchange</a></strong>. The beta version of the Bitgert Exchange went live on March 6, 2022. It positions itself as the “world’s first-ever zero trading fee crypto exchange” and currently allows trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Dogecoin.  </li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://briseswap.finance/\">BriseSwap</a></strong>. This decentralized exchange keeps a big portion of the BRISE liquidity and allows users to trade BRC20 tokens, earn on farms, etc. </li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://bridge.bitgert.finance/\">Bridge</a></strong>. The main purpose of this <a href=\"https://bitgert.com/how-to-use-the-bitgert-bridge/\">tool</a> was initially to ensure Bitgert’s migration from BSC to the Brise Chain. Now, the Bridge ensures native cross-chain communication – it allows swapping stablecoins and other tokens between BRC20, ERC20, BEP20, and Polygon. Bitgert Bridge transactions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bitgertbrise/status/1504346809690308608\">are not charged</a> with taxes.  </li>\n<li><strong>Paybrise</strong>. Great speed, high throughput, and negligible fees allow using Bitgert for P2P money transfers. Paybrise is a payment gateway that helps merchants seize this opportunity and accept BRISE. Paybrise dApp is in beta now, and it will be launched before November 2022, according to the official roadmap. </li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://bitgert.com/startups/\">Startup Studio</a></strong>.

However, you can earn it in several other ways. </p>\n<p>The BSC-based BRISE can be <a href=\"https://bitgert.finance/faq/\">staked</a> to bring you rewards. The staking of the native Bitgert blockchain’s BRISE coin will also be <a href=\"https://bitgert.finance/\">launched</a> soon.

The coin skyrocketed after the BRC20 Chain was launched in February and reached an all-time high of $0.00000404. Another reasons that brought the coin to its price peak were the release of Bitgert Exchange in beta, as well as the introduction of new partnerships and new listings. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_10_T151448_993_f152a1b44f.png\" alt=\"brise price chart\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitrise-token/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>After the price declined in May and June, Bitgert continued its growth in the last months of summer. This happened as the platform’s TVL increased from $5M to $10M in just one month, which sparked a FOMO facilitated by Bitgert’s high media activity. New protocols continue to adopt Brise Chain and deploy in its ecosystem, but Bitgert is still relatively young and is yet to prove itself.</p>\n<p>The circulating supply of BRISE is 395,688B tokens, and its market cap is as high as $306 million.

Here’s what you need to know to choose your crypto debit (or credit) card. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/09_05_crypto_credit_debit_cards_01_967a0adc51.png\" alt=\"Crypto Debit And Credit Cards: All You Need to Know\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-crypto-credit-and-debit-cards-work\">How Do Crypto Credit and Debit Cards Work?</h2>\n<p>In terms of user experience, a crypto card works just as any other bank card: you place it onto the terminal, and in a few seconds, the payment is confirmed.  </p>\n<p>Here’s how this works from a technical standpoint. First, you create an account on a crypto platform and deposit some coins (for a debit card) or borrow them (for a credit card). The sum is displayed in your balance, but that’s not the cryptocurrency you own <em>cryptographically</em> – you don’t have private keys from it, like in a non-custodial wallet. Services that issue crypto cards are custodial, meaning that the coins are stored on the company’s cold wallets and aren’t directly involved in each of your transactions.  </p>\n<p>When you pay with your card, the crypto platform deducts the money from your crypto balance and pays the store in fiat. The exact sum you’re charged is defined by the current exchange rate. Since the conversion takes place inside the crypto platform and doesn’t involve on-chain transactions, there’s no need to wait for lengthy confirmations. </p>\n<p>Both crypto debit and credit cards convert digital coins into fiat at the time you make a purchase. They are also similar in how they accrue cashback. Here’s how they are different: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Debit cards</strong> deduct a certain sum of money from the funds you already have in your crypto account. Before cryptocurrency debit cards emerged, you’d have to cash out before using these funds at a grocery store. The process could take from minutes to hours. A crypto debit card does this immediately and automatically. </li>\n<li><strong>Credit cards</strong> issue you a credit line – you borrow money from a crypto platform because you’ve deposited collateral and/or passed a successful credit check. When you pay with a crypto credit card, this is formally not your money, and you will have to repay it later. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"do-people-trust-crypto-cards\">Do People Trust Crypto Cards?</h2>\n<p>Here’s some data from Visa payment system: the volume of crypto-associated payments has reached $2.5 billion in fiscal Q1 2022. This is 70% of the entire fiscal 2021, and Visa emphasizes the increasing demand for crypto products and plans to continue to “lean into the crypto space”. The system allows paying with its crypto cards in 100 million locations globally, while Mastercard accepts payments in 90 million spots. </p>\n<p>These numbers point to one thing: customers are actively using crypto cards, while payment systems see the growing demand and expand the possibilities for cryptocurrency owners. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-choose-a-crypto-debit-or-credit-card\">How Do I Choose a Crypto Debit or Credit Card?</h2>\n<p>Here are 6 criteria that will help you pick one: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fees.</strong> Take a deep dive into the subject before ordering a crypto card – besides fees for offline purchases, there may also be charges for foreign transactions, ATM withdrawals, purchases beyond the limits, and so on. It’s best to review the card’s Terms of Use to avoid surprises. </li>\n<li><strong>Issuance.</strong> Before using any card, you’ll have to make a verified account on a crypto platform. Sometimes you’ll need to stake coins to become eligible for certain types of cards (like on Crypto.com). </li>\n<li><strong>Supported assets.</strong> Choose the card that supports cryptocurrencies you would like to invest in.</li>\n<li><strong>Cashback.</strong> You can choose an optimal card based on the amount of money you’re going to keep there and the most frequent categories of your expenses – this will maximize your cashback. </li>\n<li><strong>Availability.</strong> While some cards are available globally, others are only operating in the EU or the USA. </li>\n<li><strong>Spending limits.</strong> Usually, they are up to a few thousand USD per day. Virtual cards’ limits are smaller than those of physical ones. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"7-best-crypto-debit-cards\">7 Best Crypto Debit Cards</h2>\n<h3 id=\"сryptocom--widest-variety-of-supported-coins\">Сrypto.com – Widest variety of supported coins</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_94_506bda57c0.png\" alt=\"cryptocom card\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://crypto.com/cards\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Сrypto.com offers a 5-tier system of debit cards: the more platform’s native CRO token you stake, the better terms you have.

Before you do, consider the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Volatility.</strong> Crypto promises to start mooning one day again, but remember that it may also lose its value at the wrong time much faster than any robust fiat currency. Keeping a portion of your money in stablecoins may be a good idea, but after the collapse of TerraUSD, we need to be even more cautious. </li>\n<li><strong>Taxes.</strong> In most countries where crypto legislation is in place, selling crypto for fiat is a taxable event.

It’s a decentralized layer one solution where you can build your own dApps and complex smart contracts. Algorand is one of crypto’s most powerful blockchains, trusted to be the model of choice for thousands of organizations worldwide.</p>\n<p>This project raised over $120 million in several fund-raising campaigns during 2018 and 2019. Additional funding was secured thanks to investments from various Venture Capital Firms.    </p>\n<p>Algorand’s mainnet was launched in June 2019 with all main components up and running. The network’s native currency is ALGO, which is used for all blockchain actions like staking, paying transaction fees, and governance. </p>\n<p>This project aims to create a borderless system of trust through decentralization where people from all over the world can exchange value transparently and securely. The network supports complex smart contracts, NFTs, Web3, and DeFi. And it does all that by being eco-friendly and having no environmental impact. Its commitment to sustainability has actually resulted in Algorand becoming <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/algorand/\">carbon-negative in 2021</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"algorand-algo-team\">Algorand (ALGO) Team</h3>\n<p>The team behind this project is versatile and consists of cryptographers, mathematicians, scientists, researchers, and other industry experts.</p>\n<p>Algorand was created by <strong><a href=\"https://www.algorand.com/about/from-our-founder\">Silvio Micali</a></strong>. He is a professor at MIT who oversees the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering departments. Silvio is an excellent cryptographer and co-founder of many security protocols being used today, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Verifiable Random Functions.</p>\n<p>Besides Mr Micali, the <a href=\"https://www.algorand.com/about/our-team\">leadership team</a> also includes <strong>W. Sean Ford</strong>, the CEO and <strong>Paul Riegle</strong>, the company’s CPO. Seven other team members are responsible for research, business operations, and engineering tasks. Algorand works with dozens of advisors, economic, senior, scientific, and cryptocurrency consultants.  </p>\n<p>Two organizations are essential to the operations of Algorand. The first one is the US company <strong>Algorand Inc.</strong> which built the network. There is also the non-profit organization <strong>Algorand Foundation</strong> that oversees all development and is based in Singapore.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.algorand.foundation/team\">The Algorand Foundation</a> has its own team of industry experts that develop the Algorand platform. The Chairman of the Board is <strong>Kieron Guilfoyle,</strong> backed by <strong>Pino</strong> <strong>Persiano</strong> and <strong>Staci</strong> <strong>Warden</strong>. 40+ other individuals make up the wider team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"algorand-algo-roadmap\">Algorand (ALGO) Roadmap</h2>\n<p>Algorand doesn’t have a roadmap on its official website or social media. Therefore, pieces of information about future development must be collected from interviews with its team members and various blog posts and announcements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coinmarketbag.com/algorand-potential-in-2022-and-beyond-algo-deep-dive/\">In one such interview at MIT</a>, Algorand founder Silvio Micali announced a 10x scalability upgrade of the system in Q3 of 2022, which should increase the throughput to 10.000 transactions per second.  </p>\n<p>The second vital novelty is the introduction of decentralized token bridges representing interoperability hubs for Algorand to communicate with other crypto blockchains. Cross-chain communication was also on Algorand’s mind back in March 2022 when they expanded the platform’s smart contract functionalities. Instead of smart contracts having to be integrated into the native blockchain, it’s now possible to establish contract-to-contract calls with the needed smart contract. This new method greatly increases the speed of communication.</p>\n<p>Algorand is negotiating with different world governments to become the network of choice for their Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). <a href=\"https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/marshall-islands-to-power-worlds-first-national-digital\">The Marshall Islands</a>, for example, are already relying on the strengths of this blockchain.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"algorand-algo-network\">Algorand (ALGO) Network</h2>\n<p>Algorand is a Proof-of-Stake coin that uses a customized consensus algorithm better known as <strong>Pure Proof-of-Stake</strong> (<strong>PPoS</strong>). This system ensures excellent speed, fast block times, cost-effectiveness, and top-notch security features. New blocks are generated once every 4 to 4.5 seconds, and the blockchain can handle around 1.000 transactions per second. Network fees are minimal and cost approximately $0.0004 on average.    </p>\n<p>Algorand is a project which has solved the infamous blockchain trilemma. The perfect chain is supposed to be secure, scalable, and decentralized. Developers, however, have never managed to maintain all three positions. Until now!</p>\n<p>Algorand’s validators are <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/algorand/\">selected randomly</a> from all holders of the ALGO coin. Anyone can be chosen to add new blocks to the chain. This makes the system both decentralized and secure since no block producers have any advantage over the rest. </p>\n<p>Validator nodes are officially called <strong>Relay nodes</strong>, which are operated mainly by Algorand Inc. and the Algorand Foundation. This model ensures a scalable blockchain. Relay nodes select block producers from a list of all token holders (also known as <strong>Participation nodes</strong>). The current total node count is around 1.400.</p>\n<p>Algorand aims to become the network for a global financial system. To achieve that, their TPS count needs to increase further. Algorand’s proposal is a technology called <strong>pipelining</strong>. This is how it works: as soon as a new block is proposed by a participation node, the network will consider it valid and a part of the blockchain. The result is a drastically bigger throughput of 46.000 to 50.000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>In a decentralized system where blockchain data is stored locally on all computers that are part of the network, pipelining will create a much bigger blockchain and require more significant storage requirements. That will then cause centralization because not all node operators will have the hard drive capacity to run their servers.</p>\n<p>To battle fears of centralization, Algorand has developed the <strong>Vault</strong>. It’s a blockchain compression technology that minimizes local storage needs by distributing the blockchain across multiple network participants. Nodes can delete old account balances and maintain proper records without having to verify all historical blocks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-algorand-algo\">How to Mine Algorand (ALGO)</h2>\n<p>Since ALGO is a PoS type of coin, the asset cannot be mined, but rewards can be earned from staking. In fact, Algorand is one of the most painless cryptocurrencies to stake, and everyone can do it. You only need to send at least 1 ALGO to an appropriate wallet, and that’s all. Staking rewards are then paid out automatically. </p>\n<p>Algorand doesn’t have any fixed lockup periods or slashing feature, so you can access all your coins whenever you need to. Over 51% of the current ALGO supply is eligible for staking. The Annual Reward Rate (APR) is <a href=\"https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/algorand/\">over 7%</a> through the <strong>Algorand Governance program</strong>. This rewards system has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBcLXgt13I4\">tens of thousands</a> of participating individuals.  </p>\n<p>Participation nodes receive <strong>0.6 ALGO</strong> for each new block that gets added to the blockchain. Relay nodes don’t participate in the staking process and don’t need to stake coins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"algo-price-prediction-for-2022\">ALGO Price Prediction For 2022</h2>\n<p>Algorand is trading at around $0.28 as of early September 2022. Forecasters and investors are bullish on the asset as soon as the next bull market starts. Here are some of their thoughts:</p>\n<h3 id=\"gov-capital\">Gov Capital</h3>\n<p>According to market analysts from <strong><a href=\"https://gov.capital/crypto/algorand/\">Gov Capital</a></strong>, ALGO’s value will slightly decline in the short term. They expect the price to drop to $0.24 in the next two weeks. Their 12 months prediction is more optimistic, though. At the end of December 2023, they predict a value of $0.75/coin.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s go into a little more detail. Gov Capital believes ALGO will move above the $0.50 barrier for the first time in October 2022. From that point on, there look to be plenty of uptrends all the way to September 2023, when the asset is expected to be worth over $2.</p>\n<p>The following months should see the price bounce between $1.80 and $2.30/coin before it explodes again in September 2024 and breaches the $4 barrier. Bullish trends are expected throughout 2025, 2026, and 2027 with the maximum valuation going above $9.5 per ALGO.</p>\n<h3 id=\"digitalcoinprice\">DigitalCoinPrice</h3>\n<p>Data analysts from <strong><a href=\"https://digitalcoinprice.com/forecast/algorand\">DigitalCoinPrice</a></strong> are not as bullish as Gov Capital but still believe the asset is a good investment long-term. </p>\n<p>According to their forecast, ALGO’s max price could be $0.40 in 2022. They believe investors will need to wait until 2025 before this cryptocurrency breaks the $0.50 mark. DigitalCoinPrice analysts expect trading to happen in the $0.50 to $0.80 range throughout 2026 and 2027.</p>\n<p>ALGO could go above $1 in 2028, where the maximum price is believed to be $1.04. 2029 and 2030 show bullish signs, with the values moving from $1.13 to the new all-time high of $1.59 expected in 2031.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-buy-and-store-algorand\">Where To Buy and Store Algorand?</h2>\n<p>ALGO tokens are listed on many popular cryptocurrency exchanges. The coin is also supported in various desktop, mobile, hardware, and web wallets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"algorand-wallets\">Algorand Wallets</h3>\n<p>Algorand’s official software client is the <strong>Pera Wallet</strong>. It’s a mobile app available for Android and iOS that supports buying, storing, and swapping ALGO and other digital assets. Another outstanding mobile wallet is <strong>Trust Wallet</strong>, which comes with multicurrency support. </p>\n<p>If you want to up your security, you could use a <strong>Ledger hardware wallet</strong> that allows easy storage and staking features. <strong>Atomic Wallet</strong> is a desktop and mobile app that has integrated ALGO into its multicurrency client.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, there is the <strong>MyAlgo Wallet</strong>, which is a web wallet.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"algorand-crypto-exchanges\">Algorand Crypto Exchanges</h3>\n<p>The best exchange rates for ALGO can be found on <strong><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/algorand\">ChangeNOW</a></strong>. The platform does instant crypto swaps but also supports purchases with fiat and fixed-rate exchanges. </p>\n<p>There are many other markets where you can acquire ALGO. The most significant trading volume is recorded on <strong>Binance</strong>, <strong>Coinbase</strong>, <strong>KuCoin</strong>, <strong>Gate.io</strong>, <strong>Kraken</strong>, <strong>Huobi</strong> <strong>Global, FTX</strong>, and <strong>Bitfinex</strong>, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>You might also like to read</strong> \n<a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/how-to-mine-zcoin\">How to Mine Zcoin</a>\n<a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/how-to-buy-kishu-inu-coin-a-detailed-guide\">How to Buy Kishu Inu Coin</a>\n<a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/jasmy-coin-price-prediction\">Jasmy Crypto Price Prediction</a></p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2022-09-29T15:15:38.793Z","createdAt":"2022-09-29T15:15:37.667Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-28T09:48:30.409Z"},{"id":1299,"title":"Crypto Winter Clears the Market, Reinforces Industry Trends","description":"The “crypto winter” is not only about the collapsing value of the top coins – it also represents a fundamental shift in how the market operates.","slug":"crypto-winter-clears-the-market-reinforces-industry-trends","metaTitle":"Crypto Winter Clears the Market, Reinforces Industry Trends","metaDescription":"The “crypto winter” is not only about the collapsing value of the top coins – it also represents a fundamental shift in how the market operates.","featuredImage":{"id":6080,"name":"07.08 cryptowinter-01.png","alternativeText":"Crypto Winter Clears the Market, Reinforces Industry Trends","caption":"","hash":"07_08_cryptowinter_01_f0c3f09d11","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/07_08_cryptowinter_01_f0c3f09d11.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_07_08_cryptowinter_01_f0c3f09d11.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_07_08_cryptowinter_01_f0c3f09d11.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_07_08_cryptowinter_01_f0c3f09d11.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_07_08_cryptowinter_01_f0c3f09d11.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Old models become obsolete, while new trends emerge.

The same applies to the entire crypto market whose total capitalization dropped from $3 trillion at the end of 2021 to today’s $1T. This May, things got worse when Terra <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/changenow-may-media-digest\">collapsed</a>, sparking a massive liquidity crisis. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/celsius-cel-review-2022\">Celsius Network</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/weekly-recap-crypto-market-goes-strong-amid-bans-and-hacks\">Three Arrows Capital</a>, and many other crypto platforms and lending services went bust. </p>\n<p>There’s an opinion that this crypto winter is “warm” – it wipes out speculators who needed no more than quick gains, as well as platforms that sacrificed the security of users’ funds for the sake of profit. Bigger players such as Binance and FTX have remained intact – moreover, they are hiring new team members and creating new products. But how “warm” is the current crypto winter, actually? </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/07_08_cryptowinter_01_f0c3f09d11.png\" alt=\"Crypto Winter Clears the Market, Reinforces Industry Trends\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-panel\">The Panel</h2>\n<p>The experts who took part in the discussion are <strong>Cassio Gusson</strong>, Editor-in-Chief at CoinTelegraph Brazil, <strong>Omar Hamwi</strong>, co-founder of the Lunar Leap end-to-end crypto consulting and development company, executives from Cryptopay: <strong>Alexey Sidorov</strong>, CFO, <strong>Alex</strong> <strong>Lebedev</strong>, Customer Experience Product Owner, <strong>Konstantin Gorin</strong>, Head of Support; and <strong>Mike Ermolaev</strong>, Head of PR at ChangeNOW.</p>\n<h2 id=\"market-trends-in-the-crypto-winter\">Market Trends in the Crypto Winter</h2>\n<p><em>The recent dramatic market fall and the subsequent investors’ low sentiment are referred to by crypto enthusiasts as “crypto winter”. How is it going to influence the existing trends in the crypto industry? What trends will take over the industry in a year or two?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cassio Gusson:</strong> The cryptocurrency market goes through bullish and bearish cycles. What we&#39;re seeing now is nothing new, it&#39;s just another market cycle. However, now Bitcoin is no longer a promise, it is an investment product with ETFs, investment funds and several other institutional products. This shows that, unlike in the 2017 cycle, we now have a mega investment industry with exposure to BTC and no longer just retail investors, whales and miners. Bitcoin is no longer a “geek thing”, it is a global investment product. That said, <strong>the trend for the next few years is for more and more institutional investors to store money in Bitcoin, this will not stop, it will only grow.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Another trend is the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF</strong>, likely along with the regulation of crypto assets in the U.S. Regulation will also be a trend for the next few years around the world. This will make cryptocurrencies grow even more as financial assets and, of course, increase their value. But to paraphrase the creator of Cardano, the crypto universe will have to decide if it wants a to-the-moon with governments dictating the rules, or if we are willing to “have control of ourselves” but with the possibility of the value of crypto assets falling by 90%...</p>\n<p>And finally, <strong>another trend is metaverse and much innovation in Ethereum and in layer-2 solutions</strong> such as Matic, Solana, and a network that is still in the testing phase called Jaz Chain.</p>\n<p><strong>Omar Hamwi:</strong> Companies will reduce their staff, especially on the business side, and increase development. During the bull market, the growth outlook of new projects, new parachains, and fundraising seemed promising. In this market, however, many of these gains have been lost. It will be harder to raise investments, remain profitable, and maintain growth in this environment. This will limit the number of new projects entering the fray and reduce the projects that have not been developing. </p>\n<p>On the DeFi side, rewards will likely reduce across multiple platforms. Emerging from this crypto winter, we will likely see more project CFOs implement more creative hedging strategies to their budgets in preparation for the next winter. Most companies seemingly forgot or ignored the short cycles in Web3 in favor of positioning themselves for a long-term bull market. This has resulted in massive hits to these companies and countless layoffs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, regulations will likely be put in place that will have additional impacts to the industry. Resulting in less volatility, lower earnings, but more security. </p>\n<p><strong>Mike Ermolaev:</strong> A crypto winter is a natural market cycle and basically a stress test for crypto companies, assets, and investors. It is evident from how the recent capitulation has brought in new optimistic players into the market. As you can see, the recent collapse of some crypto companies was not a catastrophe. Despite the pain they caused, they didn&#39;t ruin the entire industry like many doomsayers predicted. In a competitive environment, weak players with illusory goals will leave, while strong players will stay. Eventually, a new wave of sophisticated projects will emerge. We are already seeing new financial blood being injected into the market, so it will soon be able to breathe easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"steady-development-or-freeze-of-operations\">Steady Development or Freeze of Operations?</h2>\n<p><em>It can be assumed that the market fall has affected the way companies develop their products. We asked the experts about what impact they see.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cassio Gusson:</strong> The crash of the market does not impact the development of the industry. In fact, it is good for eliminating bad projects and projects that are useless. That&#39;s what we saw in May, June, and July, and I believe we will see more. People have to identify the hype, or, as Public Enemy would say, &quot;don&#39;t believe the hype&quot;...  A thing isn’t good simply because it says it uses blockchain. If it invests in cryptocurrency, that doesn’t mean it&#39;s necessarily good either. If it’s an NFT, it’s not automatically good for something... of more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies that exist, there aren&#39;t 100 that are really good for something.</p>\n<p><strong>Alexey Sidorov:</strong> We had to re-assess our product development plans to delay the least predictable and risky features and focus on several areas where we expect the most industry and community interest in the upcoming months. We’ve put our effort into listing the NEAR protocol, and currently, we are exploring its various layer-2 solutions and the USN stablecoin (because we see value in what NEAR ecosystem brings to Web3 adoption). </p>\n<p>On the other hand, we focused on the traditional fiat part of our product – cards. The aim is to make them even more flexible and tailored for our customers’ needs, while remaining one of the most powerful cards on the market. Finally, we give more priority to features that will help our customers start recurring investments in crypto during the “summer sale” time.</p>\n<p><strong>Konstantin Gorin:</strong> The main impact of the market fall that I see is the emotional state of the users. They get nervous and cautious, they don&#39;t trust the support the way they did before. It&#39;s a challenge that we&#39;re happy to accept, but would&#39;ve been much easier to help the client if they didn&#39;t have to double-prove every detail along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Lebedev:</strong> Crypto can be used in many ways, but obviously it’s a bit tricky now to promote it as an investment tool. Stacking can be too risky in the current market situation, so we are doing it in a way to ensure the safety of funds in the first place. We still are able to suggest competitive rates with minimal risk. We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, security and, of course, user experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Omar Hamwi:</strong> Generally, in any recession or market downturn, one sees an uptick of layoffs especially on the business side. Development and product teams, however, are impacted less. This is largely due to product development being a priority in these downturns. Both in Web3 and in banking, one sees an increase of heads down in product development. </p>\n<p>As the crypto winter weeds out non-performing projects, those projects with merit or significant funding continue to move forward. In short, you see an evolution of the use cases and products that come out following a downturn. A saying I have been hearing around the industry – “develop in a bear market and launch in a bull market”. </p>\n<p><strong>Mike Ermolaev:</strong> The market fall shows us who has been swimming naked. In the end, the collapse of fundamentally worthless projects that enticed uninformed retail traders and high-profile investors is a positive development. Projects that want to survive will learn from these mistakes and will build better. It is clear that crypto, Web3, has captured people&#39;s imagination, adoption is accelerating, and the wheel that started rolling cannot be stopped. Crypto&#39;s creative energy will result in amazing projects, which we will be seeing in the near future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-trends-and-products\">New Trends and Products</h2>\n<p><em>When the “crypto winter” is over, we may see new products and market trends emerge in the industry. What could they be?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cassio Gusson:</strong> The trends we discussed above include the continuing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF, and the rise of metaverses and L2 solutions. Here, I would add soulbound tokens – something that could really be the hype in 2025. </p>\n<p><em>ChangeNOW’s note: Soulbound tokens are non-transferable NFTs that uniquely belong to one individual. They store significant data and allow their owners to publicly prove it. An SBT is like a digital wallet that keeps education certificates and employment history, driver’s license, and membership cards under one roof secured by the blockchain.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Alex Lebedev:</strong> It’s not the best thing to make predictions, but I would say that our world is changing a lot now, and crypto is not a “geek” thing anymore. It’s a serious tool that can make daily life better. So I expect that more people will adopt crypto in their everyday needs each month, and blockchain technologies will be used to solve new problems in daily life.</p>\n<p><strong>Omar Hamwi:</strong> Identity will likely start to take center stage, as well as disruptive applications. More use cases involving the metaverse and NFTs such as real-estate will appear. There will be more ownership through NFTs and Web3 in our day to day life (outside of just art and art-related themes). </p>\n<h2 id=\"taking-profit-from-the-crypto-winter\">Taking Profit from the Crypto Winter</h2>\n<p><em>Is it conceivable that ordinary users and crypto investors could benefit from the current market situation? If so, how? If not, what are the possible mitigation strategies?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cassio Gusson:</strong> There are always those who win and those who lose on any market day and cycle. Just look at CoinMarketCap, and you will see that there are coins that go up and coins that go down every day. Investors first need to know what they want in the cryptocurrency market to decide what strategy to take: Do I want to get rich overnight? Do I want to invest for the long term? Do I want to save in cryptocurrencies? I don&#39;t want anything, I just want to have fun and live the emotion of the charts?</p>\n<p>Anyway, the first thing is to know what you want, and after that things get easier. For example, if you want to save in cryptocurrencies, why worry about the chart going up and down? Your investment is long term, so buy a little every month and diversify your portfolio in the main projects. Now, if you want to get rich overnight, it&#39;s no use buying Bitcoin, you have to be a player who takes risks in projects of low capitalization knowing you can either lose it all or hit it hard... So define what you want first, and then strategize.</p>\n<p><strong>Konstantin Gorin:</strong> The bright side I see here is that the pace has changed. Winter means life gets slower to some decree (it definitely works this way in real life). And it means that people get more time: to learn and to clarify what’s been puzzling, more time to get a better understanding of what strategies to undertake and what they are planning to invest their money in. And that would only benefit the industry, because the smarter everyone is — the better the market evolves.</p>\n<p><strong>Omar Hamwi:</strong> There are plenty of ways to benefit from this situation. To be clear, this is not investment advice. However, for projects you believe will do well in a future bull market, this is a great time for those with liquidity to invest in them. Additionally, passive income strategies such as staking stablecoins or idle crypto is a great way to continue to earn. </p>\n<p>Also, airdrops and rewards continue to exist in a bear market, which can be converted for projects you believe in or can be held onto for a possible growth in value. </p>\n<p>Finally, it doesn’t hurt to explore more use cases or get involved within the industry. The supply of professionals in Web3 continues to be low in its early days, therefore giving you a chance to enter this market and become a coveted Web3 expert.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Crypto winter appears to be a great time to slow down and reassess the plan of action, both for businesses and individuals. It makes cryptocurrency enthusiasts put the safety of investments first and give preference to low-risk strategies (yet still, there are opportunities to earn). But despite the fact that it’s cold outside, the crypto adoption goes on, and new exciting trends are not far off. Stay warm, and take your time to build your best strategy.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":4,"name":"Industry","description":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more. \n\n","slug":"industry","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Industry - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more.

Banks or governments can’t mess with digital currency that is safely stored on your cryptocurrency wallet. Bankruptcy or frozen accounts won’t affect your assets either.</p>\n<p>But since cryptocurrencies are the product of the blockchain architecture, there are a few things that don’t go well with each other. When storing data on distributed ledger, privacy, anonymity, and data protection are not absolute and have their own peculiarities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Privacy_Anonymity_Montazhnaya_oblast_1_13f5157160.jpg\" alt=\"Crypto Privacy, Anonymity, &amp; Data Protection\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"is-crypto-traceable\">Is Crypto Traceable?</h2>\n<p>There is no such thing as absolute anonymity when conducting any type of financial operations online. And cryptocurrency transactions are no exception. Whenever you make a transaction, your data is collected and analyzed. Linking your transactions to your credentials can help service providers speed up the settlement process. At the same time, it kills the whole idea of privacy because all your activities are monitored and recorded. With crypto, things are not that different and one cannot say it is one hundred percent anonymous but rather pseudonymous.</p>\n<p>Very few coins offer you complete privacy, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> itself is far from being anonymous.  To start with, it is almost impossible to buy cryptocurrency without providing your ID. Some exchanges offer no-KYC purchases, but this option is available only for smaller amounts that don’t usually exceed a couple of hundreds USD. And when you use your passport to buy crypto, anonymity is out of the picture. </p>\n<p>Since all the legal exchanges are regulated, the government can get access to their records when necessary and track any Bitcoin transaction. Services like <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chainalysis</a> – it works with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash – help trace transactions and link them to people who made them.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin and most other coins won’t guarantee your anonymity unless you use special services to trick the system. For example, crypto mixers (or crypto tumblers) allow you to “mix” your coins with transactions of others and get new “clean” coins. Alternatively, a mixer will substitute your coins with other coins from the wallets hooked to it. Bitcoin mixers are still legal, but they have to be registered, obtain a license to operate, and comply with the AML policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-privacy-coins\">Top Privacy Coins</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency community is known for being passionate about privacy and freedom. That’s why enthusiastic developers created several coins that are focused on keeping their owners anonymous. Typically, they also offer advanced security and are partially or almost fully private. Let’s take a look at some of the most popular privacy-oriented coins.</p>\n<p><strong>Monero (XMR)</strong></p>\n<p>One of the oldest privacy-focused coins, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/monero\">Monero</a>, is using such technologies as ring signatures and stealth addresses to make its transactions untraceable. </p>\n<p>Ring signatures allow a sender to hide their identity from everyone else in the group. When signing a Monero transaction, the sender&#39;s private and public keys are combined; that helps to make the transaction unique and private. Randomly generated single-use stealth addresses bring on some extra privacy for the receiving side. </p>\n<p>This way neither sender nor receiver are exposed when they transact in the Monero ecosystem. The amount of the transaction stays hidden, too, due to the use of the RingCT technology. </p>\n<p>All Monero’s transactions are private, and you cannot send a transparent transaction even by mistake, which makes it the most anonymous coin on the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Zcash (ZEC)</strong></p>\n<p>The second largest privacy-oriented cryptocurrency is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/zcash\">Zcash</a>. Unlike Bitcoin, Zcash enables semi-transparent processing to reveal transaction data selectively. The coin uses a Zero-Knowledge Proof cryptographic tool: it helps to prove that a statement is true without revealing this statement. So, in the Zcash network, a transaction can be confirmed without disclosing its details. It also allows its users to shield transactions. This way you don’t need to know anyone’s address to send or receive Zcash tokens. The transaction amount stays hidden, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Dash (DASH)</strong></p>\n<p>Another famous privacy cryptocurrency, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dash\">Dash</a>, enables users to choose if they want their transactions to be anonymous or not. Thanks to the PrivateSend feature, you can hide only some of your transactions or keep them open if the regulatory framework of your region requires you to do so.</p>\n<p>To reach consensus, Dash uses a modified version of Proof of Stake – the X11 algorithm. This algorithm is not based on the concept of mining and uses a system of Masternodes (stakeholders) to validate transactions. Dash’s Conjoin mixing tool shuffles transactions and enhances privacy.</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, governments are not the biggest fans of privacy coins. These coins are usually associated with criminal activities on the darknet. Some countries prohibit listing privacy coins on cryptocurrency exchanges, but they are still not banned officially. </p>\n<p>And yet there’s nothing bad about privacy, and anonymity is not a crime. Everybody (and cryptocurrency and cryptography enthusiasts in particular) loves their privacy, and it’s only fair that such coins exist.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"specifics-of-data-protection\">Specifics of Data Protection</h2>\n<p>Blockchain is a technology meant to protect your data from manipulation. All the records are public and immutable, so you stay confident that nobody will mess with them. Blockchain copies data, and stores it in many places (nodes) instead of keeping it centralized. The entire copy of the master ledger is stored on every single node of the chain, and these nodes communicate with each other to validate the data and make sure it is accurate and up-to-date. </p>\n<p>However, some aspects of blockchain’s architecture might contradict local regulatory requirements. For example, there is a data protection regulation in the EU law – General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – which establishes a certain set of rules challenging compliance of the blockchain and cryptocurrency projects operating in the area.  </p>\n<p>Given that data on the blockchain is distributed to many places, it does not belong to a single owner. This goes against data privacy regulations as it requires a single owner responsible for personal data. A possible solution to this challenge suggests storing index numbers linked to the personal data in a separate database and assigning one owner (for example, an organization) that can be held accountable. </p>\n<p>Another big challenge is that blockchain doesn’t provide an option of deleting the data. All the information that has ever been recorded on a blockchain will stay there. The blockchain can change, but it will still have the record of what it used to be before that without the possibility to erase this information. Although it can be useful in some cases, data regulations are strict about the capability of deleting the data of the users whenever there’s a need for that. In this case, storing an encrypted copy of personal data in a separate database would also come in handy. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Despite popular opinion, Bitcoin and most of the other cryptocurrencies are not anonymous but pseudonymous. They provide their owners with a certain level of privacy but do not guarantee full anonymity. There are services that help track transactions and link them to the senders. Bitcoin mixers and privacy coins are meant to solve the anonymity issue, although they often fall into disfavor of the governments and are considered to be the tools for carrying out criminal activities. </p>\n<p>Transparency makes blockchain almost immune to attacks and allows us to store data securely. However, the same characteristics make it difficult to keep our personal data private since it is out there in the open. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-09-06T10:23:13.979Z","createdAt":"2022-09-06T10:23:11.811Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-06T07:51:32.264Z"},{"id":1275,"title":"Indonesia to Launch a Government-Controlled Crypto Stock Exchange by the End of 2022","description":"According to a report by DealStreetAsia, Indonesia's deputy trade minister Jerry Sambuaga has confirmed the establishment of a government-controlled crypto stock exchange.

What makes this privacy coin unique? How does the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/zcash\">ZCash</a> network manage to confirm transactions knowing nothing about the sender? Let’s find out. </p>\n<h2 id=\"about-zcash-zec\">About ZCash (ZEC)</h2>\n<p>ZCash is a digital currency that allows users to send private transactions at low fees. The idea behind ZEC was conceived in 2013 when a group of scientists from Johns Hopkins University proposed Zerocoin – an update that would enable private transactions in the Bitcoin network. After the proposal was rejected by the BTC community, scientists founded the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (now Electric Coin Company) in 2015 and launched ZCash in 2016. </p>\n<p>The idea of creating a privacy-protecting cryptocurrency emerged as it became clear: Bitcoin is unable to provide the degree of anonymity that some users need. To allow for private transactions, ZCash was the first cryptocurrency to implement zk-SNARKs – the cryptographic protocol that helps confirm a transaction without revealing its details. </p>\n<p>There are two types of addresses in the ZCash network: public t-addresses and private z-addresses. The users have a choice to send public or private transactions using these addresses. The details of private transactions are not displayed in the blockchain, but their senders can disclose transaction details for audit or compliance. </p>\n<p>Such flexibility in payment options is supposed to facilitate mass adoption of ZCash – the cryptocurrency aims to become accessible to 10 billion people by 2050. Currently, ZEC is the second-largest privacy coin after Monero and stands at the 51th position on CoinMarketCap. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/07_05_Zcash_review_2022_01_1eb09a1757.png\" alt=\"ZCash (ZEC) Review 2022\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"zcash-zec-team\">ZCash (ZEC) Team</h2>\n<p>The initial idea of Zerocoin, a privacy extension to Bitcoin, was a brainchild of Matthew Green, Ian Miers, and Christina Garman – three leading scientists from Johns Hopkins University. Once their proposal was dismissed by Bitcoin developers, Green, Miers, and Garman recruited another four researchers and laid the ground for the scientific breakthroughs that shaped ZCash. </p>\n<p>The ZCash community has grown from a small group of scientists to two independent organizations that manage ZEC and work on its code. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Electric Coin Co.</strong> is the organization that promotes ZCash development and crypto education for the masses. The company does not control ZEC and its distribution since it’s a decentralized cryptocurrency. The ECC team includes 28 devs, scientists, and educators based in Denver, Colorado. </li>\n<li><strong>Zcash Foundation</strong> is a public charitable organization that builds financial privacy infrastructure for ZCash. It participates in community management and ZEC governance, funds research and development, and distributes grants to software engineers. Zcash Foundation also promotes broader applications of zero knowledge proof technology. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"zcash-zec-roadmap\">ZCash (ZEC) Roadmap</h2>\n<p>In 2022, ZCash is focused on implementing the Network Upgrade 5 – the sixth major update for Zcash. The NU5 was activated on May 31 in accordance with the official <a href=\"https://z.cash/support/schedule/\">schedule</a>. The upgrade was supported by the Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation.</p>\n<p>NU5 aims to implement the latest advancements in the zk-SNARK technology stack and underlying cryptography. The most notable innovations include Unified Addresses and full support for the Orchard shielded protocol.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unified Addresses</strong> will free ZCash from the complexity of address types: t- and z-addresses will merge into one. This will increase the usability of ZCash, improve  interoperability between shielded-only and transparent-only ZEC apps, and facilitate network upgrades. It will become easier for developers to build on ZCash, so the users will soon access DeFi and Layer-2 features in the network.</li>\n<li><strong>Orchard shielded protocol</strong> will replace Sprout and Sapling – cryptographic tools that have powered zk-SNARKs in ZCash to date. Sprout and Sapling are incompatible with known efficient scaling solutions and have some potential vulnerabilities. Orchard will address these issues as the core element of the new Halo 2 zero-knowledge proving system of ZCash. It will “serve as a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and scalability” and will make ZEC faster and less expensive to build on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"zcash-zec-network\">ZCash (ZEC) Network</h2>\n<p>ZCash was built using the Bitcoin core code and allows sending partially or completely private transactions. Those are processed fast (ZEC block time is 75 seconds), and the fees are just 0.0001 ZCash, which is less than a US Cent. </p>\n<h3 id=\"address-and-transaction-types\">Address and transaction types</h3>\n<p>There are two types of wallet addresses in the ZCash network: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transparent, or <strong>t-addresses</strong>, are publicly viewable and allow for sending traceable transactions just like in the Bitcoin blockchain. </li>\n<li>Private, or <strong>z-addresses</strong> (also referred to as shielded addresses), let users send ZCash with transaction details hidden from the public. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since t- and z-addresses are interoperable, four types of transactions are possible in the ZCash blockchain: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>T-to-T</strong>, or a transaction sent from t-address to another t-address: sender, recipient, and the amount are publicly visible in the blockchain.</li>\n<li><strong>T-to-Z</strong>: the sender is displayed, but the receiver (shielded address) is hidden. Here’s how this looks in the block explorer: </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Z-to-T</strong>: the sender is not disclosed, while the recipient address is viewable. </li>\n<li><strong>Z-to-Z</strong>: a completely private transaction where neither the sender, nor the receiver and the transaction amount are shown to the public. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_79_247178bd3b.png\" alt=\"zcash how it works\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://electriccoin.co/blog/anatomy-of-zcash/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>To enable private transactions, ZCash leverages zk-SNARKs – a cryptographic protocol that allows one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that the statement is true without revealing any details about this statement – only information about the validity of the statement.</p>\n<p>Before May 2022, this has been done through Sprout and Sapling shielded protocols that involve elliptic curves and a so-called private setup. To eliminate the need for the latter, strengthen the security of zk-SNARKs, and increase scalability, the Electric Coin Company team implemented a new Halo 2 proving system in ZCash as part of the latest NU5 major network upgrade. </p>\n<h3 id=\"encrypted-memo-fields\">Encrypted memo fields</h3>\n<p>Memo is a field where senders of shielded transactions can include some info for receivers. This can be the purpose of payment, instructions, and so on. Memo is fully encrypted and not publicly visible. </p>\n<h3 id=\"selective-payment-details-disclosure\">Selective payment details disclosure</h3>\n<p>Senders and receivers of private ZCash money transfers can disclose transaction details to 3rd parties for regulatory compliance or auditing. A recipient can reveal the list of transactions, their sums and memo fields, but not the senders’ addresses (though this feature will become available in the future). </p>\n<h3 id=\"how-is-zcash-different-from-monero\">How is ZCash different from Monero?</h3>\n<p>While Monero is private by default, ZCash lets users choose whether they want to send a public or a private transaction. It is assumed by the ZEC team that the availability of this choice will help ZCash gain adoption faster among individuals, merchants, and financial institutions. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-zcash-zec\">How to Mine ZCash (ZEC)</h2>\n<p>ZCash is a Proof of Work cryptocurrency that you can mine solo or in a pool. Although ZEC could be mined using GPUs before, the ZCash team officially <a href=\"https://z.cash/mining-zcash/\">recommends</a> using ASICs today. </p>\n<p>ZEC runs on the Equihash mining algorithm. The coin was the first one to implement it; later, the algorithm was also adopted by Bitcoin Gold, Komodo, and other cryptocurrencies. </p>\n<p>ZCash block time is 75 seconds, and the block reward is <a href=\"https://z.cash/support/faq/#how-to-mine\">3.125 ZEC</a> since November 2020. The ZCash mining rewards halve just like Bitcoin’s, and the next halving is to occur in 2024.  </p>\n<p>If you want to assess the profitability of ZCash mining or learn how to start it, see the well-written official <a href=\"https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/zcash_mining_guide.html\">mining guide</a> and <a href=\"https://z.cash/support/faq/#how-to-mine\">Q&A</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zcash-zec-value-data\">ZCash (ZEC) Value Data</h2>\n<p>At the time of writing, ZCash is trading at $58.9 – the price has lost 79% since November 2021, which is consistent with the major bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. The current circulating supply of ZCash is 15.1 million coins, and it increases by 3.125 ZEC with every newly mined block. Like in Bitcoin, the maximum supply of ZCash is 21 million coins, and it is predicted to be reached by nearly 2050. </p>\n<p>The market cap of ZCash is $893 million, putting it in the 51st position of the CoinMarketCap’s list. </p>\n<h2 id=\"zcash-zec-2022-price-prediction\">ZCash (ZEC) 2022 Price Prediction</h2>\n<p>Price prediction services are bullish on ZCash: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wallet Investor considers ZEC a “very good” one-year investment and assumes the coin will cost $72 by September 2023. </li>\n<li>CoinPriceForecasts predicts that the ZCash will hit $80 by the end of 2022, and the $100 mark will be crossed in 2024. </li>\n<li>PricePrediction is even more positive and believes ZEC will grow to $88.7 in 2022. </li>\n<li>DigitalCoinPrice assumes that the average price of ZCash in 2022 will be $76.2, and the maximum price will hit $80.7. According to the service, ZEC may surge to $93.55 in 2023. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-buy-and-trade-zcash-zec\">How Can I Buy and Trade ZCash (ZEC)?</h2>\n<p>ZCash can be purchased on centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and others.
