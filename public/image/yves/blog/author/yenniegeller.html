Even as a newbie in the blockchain space, chances are you’ve heard about the Solana ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The network touts itself as the most performant permissionless blockchain globally, but with the crypto industry’s growth, it can be hard to keep up with all the new developments. Let’s explore Solana’s ins and outs and its evolution from its inception in 2017 up to 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-solana\">What is Solana?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-solana-blockchain\">Introducing the Solana Blockchain</h3>\n<p><strong>Solana</strong> is a blockchain platform that is designed to host decentralized and scalable applications. It is an open-source network, which means that developers can build and launch their own decentralized applications using it. Solana initially emerged as a rival to the Ethereum (<a href=\"link\">ETH</a>) blockchain. Like the latter, it offers smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s other core features include its high speed, with the potential to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, and low transaction costs averaging at $0.00025. Transaction fees on Solana are in the network’s native token, <a href=\"link\">SOL</a>.</p>\n<p>The Solana coin is a utility token that functions as a medium of exchange and helps prop up security on the platform via staking. The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former executive at Qualcomm, in 2017 and is currently run by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-solana\">A brief history of Solana</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-and-why-solana-was-created\">How and why Solana was created</h3>\n<p>Solana emerged in response to the scalability limitations of existing blockchain platforms such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BTC</a>) and Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Bitcoin price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believed that agreement on time was one of the biggest challenges of a distributed model.</p>\n<p>Yakovenko recognized that a reliable and accurate clock was crucial for network synchronization. As such, he began working on and developed the concept of <a href=\"link\">proof of history</a>. This technique allows for keeping time between untrusted computers, making network synchronization simpler and faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-exactly-is-solanas-proof-of-history\">What exactly is Solana’s proof of history?</h3>\n<p>The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism is Solana’s chosen technique to keep the time between computers that do not trust each other. The basic idea behind PoH is to use a &quot;timestamp&quot; that is generated by a central server and broadcast to all nodes on the network. This timestamp serves as a reference point for the network, allowing all nodes to agree on the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_26_18_PM_b5d4d80061.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.26.18 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"link\">Medium</a> </p>\n<p>To generate the timestamp, the central server creates a &quot;hash&quot; of a large amount of data (known as a &quot;PoH generator&quot;) and publishes it to the network. Each node on the network can then use this hash to verify the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p>The PoH generator is designed to be computationally expensive to create, ensuring it can only be generated by a central server and not by any individual node on the network. This helps to prevent any one node from manipulating the timestamp or the sequence of events.</p>\n<p>By using the PoH mechanism, Solana can achieve high levels of network synchronization and scalability, allowing it to process a large number of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement over other blockchain systems that lack a reliable clock and struggle to scale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-journey-to-the-solana-launch-yakovenkos-path\">The journey to the Solana launch: Yakovenko’s path</h3>\n<p>Solana was technically created in November 2017 when Anatoly Yakovenko published the whitepaper for the proof-of-history concept. This technique would serve as the foundation for the Solana project. With plans to weave all the world&#39;s transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called it Loom.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald <a href=\"link\">published</a> the first open-source implementation of the PoH technique on GitHub under the name Silk. The project quickly gained traction, and the team continued to develop it.</p>\n<p>By March 2018, the team rebranded the project as Solana, a nod to the small beach town where Yakovenko and his team lived and worked. In June of that same year, they had scaled the technology to run on cloud-based networks. The next month, they published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>After months of testing and development, the Solana mainnet went live on March 31, 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-price-evolution\">Solana price evolution</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-is-solana-worth\">How much is Solana worth?</h3>\n<p>Solana’s SOL token, like most cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price fluctuations. In the first few months after the launch, the Solana price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1.00.</p>\n<p>However, in late 2020, the price of Solana began to rise rapidly. Driven by the non-fungible token (NFT) hype and the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. SOL more than tripled to a peak of $18.00 in early 2021. Solana reached its all-time high of $258 in November 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_40_45_PM_ff2553a118.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.40.45 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Solana price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these gains were nearly wiped out by the end of last year due to the crypto crash and subsequent contagion. Solana’s price took a hard hit from FTX’s implosion due to its close association with the exchange and subsidiaries. SOL dropped under $10 in late December for the first time since February 2021. However, it has recovered in the past month to trade at $24.22 currently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-solana-coins-are-there\">How many Solana coins are there?</h3>\n<p>The Solana foundation revealed that the total number of Solana (SOL) coins to enter circulation is 489 million. At the moment, 260 million tokens are available on the market. </p>\n<h3 id=\"where-can-you-buy-solana\">Where can you buy Solana?</h3>\n<p>Solana (SOL) can be purchased on a variety of exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and <a href=\"link\">ChangeNow</a>. With a user-friendly interface and a wide variety of payment options, ChangeNow makes it easy for anyone to purchase SOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanas-major-developments\">Solana’s major developments</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2019\">Solana’s 2019</h3>\n<p>Right before the Solana mainnet launch, much of the team’s attention was on obtaining funding to develop its new crypto network. The project had already begun to gain traction.</p>\n<p>As such, the team was able to raise $20 million in a private token sale led by Multicoin Capital in Q1 2019. Other participants were Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2020\">Solana’s 2020</h3>\n<p>The year 2020 marked Solana’s emergence as the first blockchain to use proof of history. The platform launched on Mainnet Beta in March 2020, following successful fundraising and the launch of their public test network, Tour de SOL.</p>\n<p>That same year, <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href=\"link\">USDT</a>) launched Solana-native <strong>USDT</strong> and Circle partnered to make <strong><a href=\"link\">USDC</a></strong> a native stablecoin on the platform. Solana also held its first hackathon from October 28 to November 14.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Tether price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2021\">Solana’s 2021</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s 2020 hackathon and subsequent ones were a success, leading to an influx of developers and projects onto the platform. By December 2021, Solana had exceeded 1,000 projects and saw a significant rise in its price and daily active users. This propelled the SOL token to the fifth spot on the crypto list, surpassing <strong>Cardano</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<p>However, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for 17 hours. The platform had formerly gone down for 6 hours in December 2021, earning it a reputation for frequent outages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Cardano price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2022\">Solana’s 2022</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s outage problem persisted into 2022. Despite this, the network was able to make some progress. Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, announced integration with Ethereum and Polygon. In June, Solana revealed plans for the first crypto smartphone, the Solana Saga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/solana_saga_01_7aaaabbbc6.jpg\" alt=\"solana-saga_01.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>The platform also opened a physical store in New York City dedicated to all things crypto in July. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Solana_just_launched_a_physical_store_in_metaverse_79dcec4278.jpg\" alt=\"Solana-just-launched-a-physical-store-in-metaverse.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>Notably, Solana&#39;s NFT market experienced substantial growth in 2022, with the number of minted NFTs reaching 312,000 on September 7. Additionally, Solana NFT trading volumes rose to hit $11.5 million on September 6.</p>\n<p>However, in August, the platform&#39;s mobile wallet suffered a hack resulting in $8 million worth of losses. Thousands of Solana users suffered in the attack, which Solana ultimately blamed on a third-party platform, the Slope mobile wallet app. Solana experienced more losses later on as the FTX and Alameda saga caused the single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics as SOL dipped 96%. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solana-ecosystem\">The Solana ecosystem</h3>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem is home to a diverse range of projects, from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The platform’s speed, affordability, and scalability mean it is quickly becoming a go-to destination for developers, entrepreneurs, and users who want to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications and services. </p>\n<p>Among these projects are <strong>Phantom</strong>, a decentralized social network that empowers users to share content, earn rewards, and connect with others; <strong>Stepn</strong> (<a href=\"link\">GMT</a>), a platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows artists and creators to monetize their work. Solana also hosts <strong>Star Atlas</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ATLAS</a>), a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading digital assets, and <strong>Audius</strong>, initially built on Ethereum but moved to Solana in 2020, a decentralized streaming platform for musicians that enables them to control their music and earn royalties directly from fans.</p>\n<p>More recently, <strong>BONK</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BONK</a>),  “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people,” which was released in December 2020. </p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Like most other projects in the crypto industry, Solana reaped the benefits of 2021’s DeFi and NFT boom. In the same vein, it was unable to escape the impact of the crypto winter in 2022. Still, its attractive blend of speed and affordability, thanks to its unique technology, makes it a staple for most developers in this space. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest SOL trading pairs <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Also Read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/analyst-predicts-sols-price-prior-to-solanas-milestone-conference\">Analyst Predicts SOL’s Price Prior to Solana’s Conference</a></li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-26T19:28:00.275Z","createdAt":"2023-01-26T18:47:45.949Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-02T10:18:16.163Z"},{"id":1366,"title":"ChangeNOW stands against fraudulent actions amid Alameda wallets' suspicious activity","description":"Taking into account the company's high AML standards in terms of resistance to illegal activity, ChangeNOW is putting serious effort into preventing such incidents as the recent Alameda wallets’ case.","slug":"changenow-stands-against-fraudulent-actions-ensures-high-compliance-standards-amid-alameda-wallets-suspicious-activity","metaTitle":"ChangeNOW position amid Alameda suspicious activity","metaDescription":"The compliance team works round-the-clock with investigation inquiries related to Alameda funds movement","featuredImage":{"id":6782,"name":"12.28 Alameda Incident Statement-01.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Once fraudulent activity was first reported by investigators, the ChangeNOW compliance team responded immediately and blocklisted suspicious wallets.

First, they figured out how to accumulate enough liquidity that DEXes were lacking back in the day. Second, they managed to abandon the cumbersome order book, making decentralized exchanges lightweight and speedy. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-амм\">What Is АММ?</h2>\n<p>Automatic Market Maker is an algorithm that keeps liquidity on a decentralized exchange and defines the asset prices. When a user enters an AMM-based DEX to swap their tokens, they trade not with other users, but with a liquidity pool of that exchange. </p>\n<p><strong>A liquidity pool</strong> is a smart contract where other users (<strong>liquidity providers, or LPs</strong>) lock their tokens for a reward. This allows everyone to trade with the liquidity pool, that is – swap the coins.     </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/11_25_Automated_market_makers_AMM_Curve_Uniswap_Balancer_01_dfe9a82bc9.png\" alt=\"Automated market makers\" ></p>\n<h3 id=\"how-is-the-exchange-rate-calculated-in-amm\">How is the exchange rate calculated in AMM?</h3>\n<p>Asset prices in a liquidity pool are defined automatically based on the supply-demand balance. Let’s consider a trading pair ETH/LINK. The ratio of these coins in the pool determines their exchange rate. If someone buys ETH for LINK, this means there is now less ETH and more LINK in the pool. ETH rises in price, while LINK drops. </p>\n<p>The rate is calculated via an AMM <strong>formula</strong>. The simplest one is implemented in Uniswap and looks like this: <strong>x * y = k</strong>, where** x** is the amount of token A, **y **is the amount of token B, and **k **is a constant meaning that the total liquidity of the pool remains unchanged. </p>\n<p>The concept of AMM has evolved over time, and there are now plenty of its different types. DEXes like Balancer allow creating pools for 3 and more tokens, while the AMM of Curve enables trading of assets with similar price: like ETH/WETH or USDC/DAI. </p>\n<p>AMM-based exchanges are a backbone of today’s DeFi. The total value locked in all DEXes is <a href=\"https://defillama.com/dexs\">$3.4 billion</a>, and most of them run on Automatic Market Maker.   </p>\n<h2 id=\"why-amm\">Why AMM?</h2>\n<p>To understand why AMM was invented, let’s see how all crypto exchanges had operated before. </p>\n<p>The cornerstone of a centralized exchange like Binance is the <strong>order book</strong> – a log where exchange rates are shaped. Traders enter the platform with a proposal to buy or sell an asset at a certain price, and the <strong>match engine</strong> connects users whose ask and bid prices… match. </p>\n<p>This is how the first decentralized exchanges on Ethereum operated, too. But their non-custodial nature suggests that all order book operations have to run on-chain – and this considerably hindered trading. When DEXes first emerged, Ethereum couldn’t boast enough speed and low fees to ensure a good user experience for order book-based DEXes. </p>\n<p>This is where AMM came on stage. It replaced order books with concise liquidity pool smart contracts that collected liquidity and defined the price. This made DEXes way more efficient and has helped form DeFi as we know it.  </p>\n<p>AMM was first proposed by the Gnosis founder Alan Liu. His ideas were outlined in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/\">Reddit post</a> by Vitalik Buterin in 2016 and then later described by Ethereum co-founder in his <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/06/22/marketmakers.html\">blog</a> in 2017. </p>\n<h2 id=\"risks-of-trading-in-amm\">Risks of Trading in AMM</h2>\n<p>Non-custodial decentralized trading comes at a cost, and AMMs have some risks that are missing in centralized platforms. They include **slippage **(relevant if you swap your tokens in a decentralized exchange) and <strong>impermanent loss</strong> (a threat for liquidity providers). </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-slippage\">What is slippage?</h3>\n<p>Slippage happens when the expected transaction price and the actual transaction price are different. In decentralized exchanges, this occurs because AMM adjusts prices in the pool when the amount of liquidity changes. In <strong>positive slippage</strong>, the price goes in a favorable direction and you receive more than expected, and in <strong>negative slippage</strong>, you get less. </p>\n<p>Most DEXes offer the tools to save you from negative slippage. By default, <strong>slippage tolerance</strong> is usually set at 0.1% or 0.5% – if the price changes unfavorably by more than this percentage, your transaction will revert. You can enter another slippage tolerance rate manually. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-impermanent-loss\">What is impermanent loss?</h3>\n<p>Impermanent loss is when the assets locked in a pool cost less than if you simply held them in your crypto wallet. </p>\n<p>This happens when the general market price and the one defined by the AMM are different. “Impermanent” means that until the provider hasn’t withdrawn their liquidity from the pool, their loss remains unrealized.  </p>\n<p>Let’s give it an example. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say, you’ve put 1 ETH and 1,200 DAI in a pool (at a 50:50 ratio). Let’s suppose that these funds are 10% from the total liquidity of the pool (so there is 10 ETH and 12,000 DAI overall). </li>\n<li>Ethereum market price suddenly surges to $2,400, but the price is still the same in your DEX. Nimble arbitrageurs come instantly to buy some cheap Ether.</li>\n<li>Now, there’s only 5 ETH and 12,000 DAI in the pool (whereas total liquidity has remained at the same $24,000 – remember the “k” from the formula?).</li>\n<li>Your share is still 10%. If you withdraw your liquidity right now, you will receive 0.5 ETH and 1,200 DAI. </li>\n<li>The funds that you withdraw will cost $2,400 – just like at the very start. But if you simply held ETH in your wallet, you would now have 1 ETH worth $2,400 plus 1,200 DAI. The loss stops being impermanent once you withdraw your liquidity from the pool. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In reality, such price swings occur far more smoothly. Extremely sharp market price changes are uncommon, and there are always arbitrageurs – bots that spot the price gaps between DEXes and smooth them out while earning the difference. </p>\n<p>Let’s now take a look at some of the most prominent decentralized exchanges leveraging the AMM model. </p>\n<h2 id=\"uniswap\">Uniswap</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_15_cc9dca40fd.png\" alt=\"unnamed (15).png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Uniswap_Logo_and_Wordmark.svg\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap\">Uniswap</a> is the first-ever AMM DEX launched in November 2018. It was conceived by a young engineer Hayden Adams soon after he was laid off from Siemens – which, in his words, was &quot;<em>the best thing that ever happened to me.</em>&quot; Adams simply started to learn Solidity, Ethereum’s programming language, and soon, the first AMM went live. </p>\n<p>Uniswap is a classic of decentralized exchanges with over $1 billion of total value locked. The DEX is available on Ethereum and its L2 chains (Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism) and boasts a radically simple design that has been copied by dozens of DEXes. The number of features available here isn’t high, but their convenience has secured the leading position of Uniswap: it’s super easy to connect a wallet, swap tokens, provide liquidity, and track pool statistics. </p>\n<p>Despite its simplicity, Uniswap always finds things to improve. In May 2020, the team launched Uniswap V2, enabling direct ERC-20 to ERC-20 token swaps – and making ETH unnecessary as an intermediary asset, which dropped the platform’s gas fees. Later in 2020, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/uniswap\">UNI</a> governance token was introduced, and in May 2021, Uniswap V3 was set in motion. The third iteration of the protocol enabled concentrated liquidity – a more efficient way for liquidity providers to allocate their funds in pools. </p>\n<h2 id=\"curve\">Curve</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_16_910951fccb.png\" alt=\"unnamed (16).png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logovectordl.com/curve-fi-logo-vector-svg/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/swap\">Curve</a> is an AMM focused on stablecoin trading. Liquidity pools of assets with similar value require a special technical solution, and Curve has managed to devise one. In Curve, you can swap DAI, USDT, USDC, FRAX, and many other tokens with low fees and slippage. </p>\n<p>The decentralized exchange is the second-largest in terms of TVL ($876 million), and besides Ethereum with its L2 networks, it operates on other blockchains like Fantom and Avalanche. Liquidity providers of Curve receive a reward in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/crv-erc20\">CRV</a> – a governance token for CurveDAO that can be used for decentralized governance of the protocol. </p>\n<h2 id=\"pancakeswap\">PancakeSwap</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_17_ed16c9ad4e.png\" alt=\"unnamed (17).png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pngall.com/ru/pancakeswap-crypto-png/download/85476\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pancakeswap.finance/\">PancakeSwap</a> is the largest decentralized exchange on BNB Smart Chain and the third-largest among all DEXes ($270 million of TVL). After BSC was launched in September 2020 with its revolutionary low fees, PancakeSwap has become the backbone of the nascent BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Luckily for BSC fans, PancakeSwap offers plenty of features inaccessible in Uniswap. For instance, liquidity providers can earn <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/pancakeswap-bsc\">CAKE</a> token as reward and stake it right here in “Syrup pools” to maximize their gains. In PancakeSwap farms, users can also stake LP tokens (assets that LPs receive as a representation of their share in the pool). Another feature that PancakeSwap enables is quite rare for DEXes — limit trading. </p>\n<p>In the Swap section, users can click the “Scan Risk” button to assess the credibility of a chosen token. This adds safety – there are thousands of tokens in BSC, and far not all of them boast secure smart contracts. </p>\n<h2 id=\"balancer\">Balancer</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_18_e603a7b492.png\" alt=\"unnamed (18).png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://searchvectorlogo.com/balancer-fi-logo-vector-svg/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://balancer.fi/\">Balancer</a> is an AMM released in March 2020 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The protocol is the fifth-largest DEX with $96 million of TVL.   </p>\n<p>In Balancer, users create liquidity pools of 3 and even up to 8 assets. LPs can deposit tokens not only in a 50:50 ratio like in Uniswap: it’s possible to provide the pool with, for example, 60% of ETH, 20% of MKR, and 20% of USDC. This makes Balancer pools similar to asset portfolios or even financial indexes. And these pools are customizable, which gives LPs more yield opportunities and grants regular users with favorable swap conditions.   </p>\n<p>Balancer also has its native token, BAL – LPs receive it as reward for depositing liquidity in pools. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/balancer\">BAL</a> and the tokens of other AMMs – <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/uniswap\">UNI</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/crv-erc20\">CRV</a>, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/pancakeswap-bsc\">CAKE</a> – are available on ChangeNOW instant crypto exchange service. Unlike a DEX, this platform allows trading 450+ assets from dozens of blockchains with an average swap time of 5 minutes. Anyone can use ChangeNOW without registration and hidden fees.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Ex editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T17:20:50.693Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-12-13T14:50:18.392Z","createdAt":"2022-12-13T14:50:12.615Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T14:50:18.409Z"},{"id":1349,"title":"What is Polygon (MATIC) and How Does It Work","description":"Polygon is a blockchain that operates on the proof-of-stake consensus model, and MATIC is the native token of this blockchain.","slug":"what-is-polygon-matic-and-how-does-it-work","metaTitle":"What is Polygon (MATIC), How Does It Work and How to Use It? | ChangeNOW","metaDescription":"Polygon is a blockchain that operates on the proof-of-stake consensus model, and MATIC is the native token of this blockchain.

It&#39;s one of many blockchains out there but has some unique characteristics that set it apart.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-polygon\">What is Polygon?</h2>\n<p>Polygon is a proof-of-stake blockchain that was founded in 2017 by four Indian software engineers to improve on some aspects of the popular <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain. </p>\n<p>Proof-of-stake means that transactions on the blockchain are verified by dedicated validators that stake their tokens on the blockchain. It doesn’t rely on computers solving complex mathematical equations to verify transactions, i.e., proof-of-work.</p>\n<p>The Polygon blockchain is actually built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, it operates as a “sidechain”. It offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees than the Ethereum blockchain, which is why it has gained a considerable number of users since its launch in 2017.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/what_is_polygon_matic_d164eebc2a.png\" alt=\"what-is-polygon-matic\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-matic\">What is MATIC?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/polygon-matic\">MATIC</a> is the Polygon blockchain’s native token. It is used to govern and secure the Polygon blockchain and pay transaction fees to the network. You can buy MATIC tokens on a centralized exchange like <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW</a> or stake existing tokens on the Polygon blockchain and earn more as a reward.</p>\n<p>MATIC holders can vote on important decisions concerning the Polygon blockchain, e.g, fees and burn rate. There are currently 8.7 billion MATIC tokens in circulation out of a maximum supply of 10 billion. The token has a total market capitalization of over $6 billion, according to <em>CoinMarketCap</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-polygon-matic-work\">How Does Polygon (MATIC) Work?</h2>\n<p>The Polygon blockchain is made up of three different layers with specific functions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Ethereum Layer</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ethereum is the base blockchain upon which Polygon is built. The Polygon chain activates the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism by staking <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-smart-contracts\">contracts</a> on the Ethereum blockchain. The staking contracts include the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any user can become a validator by <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/staking-explained-all-you-need-to-know\">staking</a> MATIC tokens on the Ethereum mainnet.</li>\n<li>Validators earn rewards – a percentage of transaction fees paid to the blockchain – for their service.</li>\n<li>Users can save checkpoint transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Heimdall Layer</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Heimdall layer includes a collection of nodes that run in parallel to the Ethereum mainnet. These nodes monitor the staking contracts deployed on the Ethereum layer and also monitor network checkpoints. The Heimdall layer is based on the Tendermint blockchain.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Bor Layer</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Bor layer includes a collection of nodes responsible for accumulating transactions into blocks – it&#39;s the block producer for the Polygon sidechain. The Bor layer is built on the Go-Ethereum (Geth) client. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-polygon-network\">How to Use Polygon Network</h2>\n<p>Follow these steps to use the Polygon network:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the NOW Wallet by heading to this link; <a href=\"https://www.walletnow.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.walletnow.app</a>. It’s a non-custodial wallet available on both desktop and mobile devices. </li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Buy/Sell crypto</strong> tab and choose MATIC, or find MATIC on the Wallets tab and click the <strong>Buy</strong> button.</li>\n<li>Choose the fiat currency you want to buy MATIC with and enter your card details. After paying, you’ll receive the equivalent of the fiat amount in MATIC tokens in your wallet within five minutes. </li>\n<li>Now, you have MATIC in your NOW wallet. You can store, send, receive, or swap it for other tokens directly from the app.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"polygon-vs-ethereum\">Polygon vs. Ethereum</h2>\n<p>Ethereum is a “Layer 1” blockchain, while Polygon is a “Layer 2” blockchain built atop Ethereum. Ethereum is the most popular blockchain globally, with over 500,000 active addresses. The total number of transactions on Ethereum exceeded the number of transactions on the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain for the first time in 2021. </p>\n<p>Polygon is a <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/blockchain-scaling-explained\">scaling</a> solution to Ethereum. It solves the problem of Ethereum having high gas fees by bundling transactions together. Gas fees on Polygon are measured in pennies, while Ethereum gas fees are measured in dollars. </p>\n<p>Polygon is a much faster blockchain than Ethereum. It can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, whereas Ethereum tops out at 17 transactions per second. In summary, Polygon gives you the features of the Ethereum blockchain but with much faster transaction speeds and lower fees. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-polygon-matic\">How to Buy Polygon (MATIC)?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Head to the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/polygon-matic\">MATIC token</a> exchange page.

With such a diversity of use cases, there is a need to make tokens coexist within one blockchain (that is, make them interoperable) while preserving the security of code and ensuring it’s easy to launch them. Token standards provide such unification. </p>\n<h3 id=\"a-digital-vending-machine\">A digital vending machine</h3>\n<p>Before we delve into particular standards, let’s mention something that lets them operate – smart contracts. Their developer Nick Szabo called them digital vending machines: when specific predefined conditions are met (snack is picked and the money is deposited), you receive the result (the snack) without any extra human-driven decisions or intermediaries. In this example, the money that you insert in the machine is tokens. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/11_17_What_are_Token_Standards_01_c830c1ff96.png\" alt=\"What are Token Standards\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-token-standards\">Ethereum Token Standards</h2>\n<p>In Ethereum, there is a document kit that instructs how to develop smart contracts. It’s called the ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment), it determines features of every token standard and ensures smooth communication between smart contracts. Anyone can propose their own ERC standard, but it has to be thoroughly reviewed by the Ethereum community first and accepted by a decentralized team of developers. </p>\n<p>Two most widely used Ethereum token standards today are ERC-20 and ERC721. </p>\n<h3 id=\"erc-20\">ERC-20</h3>\n<p>ERC-20 is the main Ethereum standard for <strong>fungible tokens</strong> – that is, all assets of this format are equal in terms of type and value. In other words, for instance, 1 DAI token always equals any other DAI token. </p>\n<p>The great majority of Ethereum tokens that you know are in ERC-20 standard. Here are their main types: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Utility tokens</strong> are necessary to get access to features in a certain application. They are used more for benefits within this dApp rather than as means of exchange or investment. For example, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/decentraland\">MANA</a> is a utility token that lets you pay for goods and services in the Decentraland metaverse. </li>\n<li><strong>Governance tokens</strong> allow users to manage a crypto platform in a decentralized form. These assets are used in voting regarding the protocol’s future, new features, and use of its treasury. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/uniswap\">UNI</a> is the governance token of Ethereum&#39;s largest decentralized exchange, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/maker\">MKR</a> helps manage Maker protocol. </li>\n<li><strong>Stablecoins</strong> help users peg their crypto to fiat currencies. Some tokens like <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies\">USDT</a> are issued by a centralized entity, while others are minted by a decentralized lending protocol when a user deposits collateral (like the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dai\">DAI</a> stablecoin). </li>\n<li>**Liquidity pool tokens. **When you provide liquidity to a pool at a decentralized exchange, you receive an LP token that represents your share in this pool. For instance, if you put money in the <a href=\"https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x5777d92f208679db4b9778590fa3cab3ac9e2168\">USDC/DAI</a> pool on Uniswap, you will get a USDC-DAI LP Token. </li>\n<li><strong>Wrapped assets</strong> serve as Ethereum-based representations of another chain’s coins. Wrapped Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin\">WBTC</a>) is a well-known example. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>ERC-20 standard was proposed in November 2015 in a <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20\">EIP-20</a> personally by Vitalik Biterin. The Ethereum co-founder called it “a standard interface for tokens”: the platform was growing and many tokens of all kinds were being launched, so there was a need for a common framework. </p>\n<p>ERC-20 has become this framework. It allows tokens to be transferred and to be spent by other Ethereum-based dApps. An ERC-20 asset can be customized for governance, rewards, and more. Despite many imperfections, the standard has become ubiquitous. </p>\n<h3 id=\"erc-721\">ERC-721</h3>\n<p>In 2018, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal database added an <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721\">EIP-721</a> that described a standard for <strong>non-fungible tokens</strong>. Compared to fungible ERC-20 assets, these are not interchangeable: each one is unique and cannot be replaced by another. An ERC-721 asset is attached to a specific object. According to the original proposal, this object can be: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical property — houses or unique artwork,</li>\n<li>Virtual collectibles — unique pictures or collectible cards,</li>\n<li>“Negative value” assets — loans and other responsibilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Almost 5 years have passed since these words were written. How precise were the standard authors’ predictions, and how are ERC-721 tokens used today? </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Digital collectibles.</strong> Here, the developers were right – an <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/top-10-of-the-worlds-most-outstanding-nfts\">NFT boom</a> of 2021 was partially due to the surge of digital collections like CryptoPunks or the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The most expensive CryptoPunk #5822 has been recently sold for 8,000 ETH ($23.7 million).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Crypto_Punk_9ee2a22f06.png\" alt=\"Crypto Punk\" ></p>\n<p>One of the most expensive NFTs ever sold. <a href=\"https://medium.com/nswap/24-million-secret-behind-the-highest-ever-cryptopunk-5822-f3ee997e48e9\">Image source</a> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Game items.</strong> Unique in-game characters or cards all <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/play-move-learn-to-earn-how-to-monetize-your-passions\">exist</a> as NFTs, like the monsters in Axie Infinity. ERC-721 tokens are even used for off-chain games: in the STEPN move-to-earn app, you need to buy NFT sneakers to start receiving rewards for running. </li>\n<li><strong>Land in the metaverse.</strong> The aforementioned MANA ERC-20 token allows you to receive LAND – an NFT that represents land parcels in the Decentraland metaverse. </li>\n<li><strong>Unique artwork.</strong> Looks like EIP-721 authors were right about this one, too. NFT art trades are a million-dollar industry; in 2021, a compilation of works by digital artist Beeple <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/top-10-of-the-worlds-most-outstanding-nfts\">was sold</a> for $69 million. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a broader sense, ERC-721 non-fungible tokens are about proved digital ownership. When you possess an NFT, it means there’s a record  in a public immutable database trusted by everyone that you own a digital item. This has never been possible before blockchain and NFTs. </p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-standard-expands-to-other-networks\">Ethereum Standard Expands to Other Networks</h2>\n<p>As Ethereum gained traction, a massive ecosystem of dApps has emerged on top of it. But as years went by, it became clear that the network couldn&#39;t handle the increased demand in transaction volume: the blockchain frequently got congested, and the gas fees soared. </p>\n<p>To remain competitive, Ethereum announced the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/top-10-of-the-worlds-most-outstanding-nfts\">Merge</a> and all the subsequent scaling measures. But the crypto community doesn’t like to wait for profits – and many competitors to Ethereum have emerged. </p>\n<p>Their goal was not to create new ecosystems from scratch, but to move Ethereum-based dApps and tokens to new networks with faster transactions and cheaper gas. Consequently, token standards in new blockchains needed to remain similar to ERC-20. This is how EVM-compatibility emerged. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-evm\">What is EVM?</h3>\n<p>Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, is a distributed network of computers that collectively execute smart contracts. Regardless of the physical location, network members compute by the same rules without any centralized governance. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-an-evm-compatible-blockchain\">What is an EVM-compatible blockchain?</h3>\n<p>An EVM-compatible network operates by a set of rules that are very similar to original Ethereum rules. This way any Ethereum-based application can be easily deployed on this network with no need for reconfiguration – and users can enjoy the same features with lower gas fees and faster transactions. </p>\n<h2 id=\"evm-compatible-blockchains-and-their-standards\">EVM-compatible Blockchains and Their Standards</h2>\n<p>In 2022, there’s over a dozen large EVM-compatible networks: BSC, TRON, Avalanche, Fantom, Celo Network, Harmony, and others. This list also includes layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum (blockchains that run on top of it) such as Polygon and Arbitrum. </p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some of these networks’ token standards. </p>\n<h3 id=\"bep-20\">BEP-20</h3>\n<p>BEP-20 is the token standard of BNB Smart Chain – the second blockchain launched by Binance in September 2020. BEP-20 defines who and how can spend BSC-based tokens and other rules of their operation.</p>\n<p>The standard was designed as an extension of ERC-20 that would facilitate the launch of all kinds of assets. Powered by gas many times cheaper than on Ethereum, BEP-20 sparked the emergence of thousands of tokens on BSC. </p>\n<h3 id=\"bep-2\">BEP-2</h3>\n<p>It is worth noting that Binance has another token standard: BEP-2. It was inherent to Binance Chain, the first blockchain launched by Binance in 2019 for decentralized trading. However, the network hadn’t gained widespread adoption. </p>\n<p>In 2022, two networks <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/amp/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918\">merged</a> into one BNB Chain, and Binance chain became its governance layer. BEP-2 is compatible with ERC-20 and BEP-20, and tokens of two Binance standards can be swapped at the BSC Token Hub. </p>\n<h3 id=\"trc-20\">TRC-20</h3>\n<p>TRC-20 is the token standard for TRON, a blockchain-based operating system launched by the TRON Foundation under Justin Sun. The standard describes how new tokens must be issued, how their transfer is performed, and how assets are sent and received. </p>\n<p>The TRON Virtual Machine is EVM-compatible and uses the same programming language, Solidity. This ensures seamless integration of Ethereum smart contracts into TRON, while the platform’s high throughput guarantees low fees and high transaction speed. </p>\n<h3 id=\"perks-of-evm-compatibility-cross-chain-swaps\">Perks of EVM compatibility: Cross-chain swaps</h3>\n<p>ERC-20, BEP-20, and TRC-20 are highly interoperable token standards, and this allows for a direct value exchange between Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain and TRON blockchains. For example, you can easily swap USDT ERC-20 to USDT BEP-20 with minimal losses using the <a href=\"https://app.multchain.online/#/router\">Multichain</a> bridge.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"non-evm-compatible-networks\">Non-EVM-Compatible Networks</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, ERC-20 has some drawbacks that limit its capability. In an effort to make blockchain more efficient, some layer-1 networks have created their own token standards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nep-141--near-protocol\">NEP-141 – NEAR Protocol</h3>\n<p>NEAR is a blockchain of the new generation: it has had a sharded architecture from the very start, while Ethereum is only planning to implement it. The NEAR ecosystem boasts over 800 projects building in it and 400,000 daily transactions. </p>\n<p>NEAR has a few standards for fungible tokens, including NEP-141 and NEP-148. In contrast to NEAR native coin and ERC-20 assets, NEP-141 tokens are not stored in users’ wallets – rather, each token resides in its own contract. The latter has the data about how many tokens users own and handles transactions internally. </p>\n<p>Although the NEAR blockchain is not EVM-compatible, one part of its ecosystem is. Aurora blockchain runs on top of NEAR and creates a bridge between the latter and the Ethereum network. Currently, the TVL of NEAR and Aurora is about $127 million each. </p>\n<h3 id=\"cardano-native-tokens\">Cardano native tokens</h3>\n<p>Can tokens operate without a smart contract – and even with no token standard as we know it? Cardano says: they definitely can. In its network, tokens are <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/vasil-hard-fork-explained-what-changes-for-cardano\">“native”</a> to the blockchain – it already contains their code, and there’s no need for any extra. This reduces the risk of a human error: by removing smart contracts, Cardano gets rid of all their vulnerabilities and associated money loss risks. </p>\n<p>On top of that, Cardano tokens have the same status as the platform’s native ADA coin. On the contrary, in Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens are very distinct from ETH, which sometimes creates inconveniences to users. </p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Token standards define the common rules that all tokens of a certain kind have to follow. Ethereum’s most widely used ERC-20 standard establishes fungible tokens like UNI or DAI, and ERC-721 is for NFTs. </p>\n<p>EVM-compatible networks apply a similar standard (like BEP-20 for BNB Smart Chain or TRC-20 for TRON) so that Ethereum apps could easily migrate there. These blockchains are interoperable and connect via cross-chain bridges.</p>\n<p>Non-EVM-Conparible networks like NEAR and Cardano have their own token standards.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Ex editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T17:20:50.693Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-11-22T17:27:50.911Z","createdAt":"2022-11-22T17:26:38.233Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-22T17:27:50.932Z"},{"id":1345,"title":"Chiliz Coin Review 2022","description":"Football is the world’s most popular sport, and thanks to Chiliz, there is now a sports engagement platform where fans can influence some of their teams’ decisions.

It’s based on the Chiliz blockchain and allows individuals to purchase <strong>fan tokens</strong> through <strong>Fan Token Offerings</strong>, giving them voting rights and many other benefits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/socios_2e21c95e13.jpg\" alt=\"socios\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.socios.com/the-app/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Owning fan tokens can get you match tickets, VIP passes, meetings with star players, stadium tours, and so on. Certain clubs have been known to provide discounts on official merchandise or signed match kits. Even greater influence is offered in some instances where it becomes possible to elect board members or management. The possibilities are endless and depend solely on the imagination of the clubs involved. </p>\n<p>Thanks to the partnership with <strong>Enjin</strong>, it will also become possible to create dynamic and limited NFTs associated with specific sporting events and achievements. Suppose a player scores a spectacular goal in the Champions League finals. In that case, Chiliz could mint a commemorative NFT and offer it for sale.   </p>\n<p>The club fan tokens and Chiliz CHZ tokens have a unique relationship. CHZ assets are required to purchase any coins issued on the platform. </p>\n<p>What is Chiliz coin used for? </p>\n<p>For example, holders of the Juventus fan tokens were allowed to vote on the design of the official club bus for the 2020/2021 season. In other instances, fans could select which kit designs they liked the most or the name of the club training facilities. A Cyprian club took it one step further. It allowed their token holders to select the lineups and formations for a match the team played.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chiliznet\">Chiliz.net</h3>\n<p>The other essential part of the ecosystem is the official exchange for sports tokens – **Chiliz.net. **That’s the marketplace where traders can buy or sell their digital assets using CHZ as the other coin in the trading pair. The exchange doesn’t charge trading fees for buying fan tokens with CHZ.  </p>\n<p>Chiliz.net can also be used for purchasing CHZ tokens. Depending on the amount, customers can be asked to undergo KYC verification.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-chiliz-chz\">How to Mine Chiliz (CHZ)</h2>\n<p>CHZ is an Ethereum or Binance Chain-based token, so it can’t be mined. There is no official staking platform created by Chiliz either. However, some crypto exchanges give their customers a chance to increase their holdings through Earn programs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With <strong><a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/earn/chz\">Binance Earn</a></strong>, holders can lock up their CHZ for 1 to 5 years. The estimated APR is <strong>2%</strong>. </li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.okx.com/earn\">OKX</a></strong> also offers staking returns on Chiliz coins and <strong>1%</strong> APYs. This investment choice comes with flexible terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chiliz-coin-price-prediction-2022\">Chiliz Coin Price Prediction 2022</h2>\n<p>Chiliz’s CHZ token is trading around the $0.18 mark in the last week of October 2022. More than 6 billion assets are in circulation from a maximum supply of 8.8 billion. Crypto analysts have shared their ideas about the future of this cryptocurrency. Let’s take a look at some of their thoughts, and answer the question – is Chiliz coin a good investment?</p>\n<h3 id=\"digitalcoinprice\">DigitalCoinPrice</h3>\n<p>Trading experts from <strong><a href=\"https://digitalcoinprice.com/forecast/chiliz\">DigitalCoinPrice</a></strong> have released their Chiliz coin price prediction analysis until 2031. </p>\n<p>2022 is almost behind us, and they don’t expect much to happen in this year&#39;s remaining months. The price looks to bounce around between $0.16 and $0.22 per token. A slight upward trend is predicted for 2023, when the coin could trade from $0.40 to $0.47 apiece.</p>\n<p>Bullish segments are present in 2024 and 2025, when CHZ is expected to be worth over $0.80 on listed exchanges. But everything that goes up has to eventually come down, and Chiliz is no different. In 2026, DigitalCoinPrice expects a reversal and a drop in value to the $0.70 area.</p>\n<p>What most traders want to know is, can Chiliz reach $1? Following an eventful 2027, this is expected to happen in 2028. But CHZ doesn’t show signs of stopping there. The value looks set to rise to over $2 in 2030 until the asset reaches its ATH at the end of 2031 at $3.50 per token.</p>\n<h3 id=\"coinskid\">CoinsKid</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s one way of thinking. Let&#39;s now look at the Chiliz prediction from <strong><a href=\"https://www.coinskid.com/crypto/chiliz-chz/forecast/\">CoinsKid</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>Their forecast system anticipates a slight value increase to $0.21 this year. The average trading price throughout 2023 could be between $0.23 and $0.32 per CHZ. Positive strides are predicted in 2024 and 2025 as well. It’s believed that Chiliz will rise above the $0.50 mark for the first time in October 2024.</p>\n<p>CoinsKid market analysts anticipate that CHZ will be worth between $0.70 and $0.85 in Q4 of 2025. They end their Chiliz price prediction by sharing their forecast for 2026. There are expectations that the coin will trade at over $1 in February for the first time in its history. From that point on, the value could go up to as high as $1.75 at the end of the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-buy-and-store-chz\">Where To Buy and Store CHZ</h2>\n<p>If you have decided to invest in CHZ, we need to discuss how to buy Chiliz and which wallets it can be kept in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chiliz-wallets\">Chiliz Wallets</h3>\n<p>Just a reminder – CHZ is available as an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token or a BEP2 coin on Binance Smart Chain.</p>\n<p>The easiest and most secure storage for Chiliz tokens is in <strong><a href=\"https://walletnow.app/chiliz-wallet#how-it-works\">NOW Wallet</a></strong>.

The solution is taking advantage of modern technology and using <strong>automated crypto trading</strong> to work in your favor. Trading doesn’t have to be complicated when you can configure computer systems to automatically analyze, predict, and execute market orders in your name. </p>\n<p>Let’s see how crypto automated trading really works. What types are there, and what are some of the platforms and services you should definitely check out to maximize your profits on cryptocurrency markets. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/11_03_Automated_Crypto_Trading_01_5249e598e8.png\" alt=\"Automated Crypto Trading\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-crypto-trading-bots\">What Are Crypto Trading Bots?</h2>\n<p>Simply put, the term automated crypto trading refers to the use of special software called trading bots to buy and sell selected cryptocurrencies based on the instructions you gave it. Since the programs can operate autonomously, the trader doesn’t have to be present to manually press the ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ buttons on an exchange. By now, we are sure you can already see the benefits of automation and how much time such strategies can free up for you to focus on other things.</p>\n<p>Crypto bots monitor market movements and use algorithms to execute orders with precision. These modern apps use various strategies and can buy or sell crypto at certain prices or when specific technical indicators are aligned. Compared to you and me, automated crypto trading is emotionless. </p>\n<p>Is crypto bot trading profitable? Computer software will not succumb to emotions like fear, stress, or greed. That makes them ideal trading companions because even if you become attached to a digital asset, your crypto bot will sell it for profit in the blink of an eye.           </p>\n<p>Automated trading bots don’t get tired. They don’t need to rest, take breaks, go out for dinner, or watch a movie. We, the people, need all of that, and when we do, we can be sure that our digital helpers will continue the work for us. The app will always do what it was configured for by following the parameters provided to it.</p>\n<p>Most crypto traders want to buy the dip and sell assets at their peak. But this isn’t an exact science, and waiting too long can result in failing to take profits. Bots don’t have those problems because hesitation is not part of their configuration. </p>\n<p>Automated trading software can be tested in simulated environments before allowing the application to trade with real money. Following the results in demo mode lets you know what to expect in live market conditions.</p>\n<p>A few seconds too early or too late differentiates a good trader from a less successful one. Crypto automated trading makes portfolio diversification easier. Working with dozens of coins on multiple markets can be troublesome for humans, but not for crypto bots. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-types-of-automated-crypto-trading-are-there\">What Types of Automated Crypto Trading Are There?</h2>\n<p>Crypto trading bots can essentially be divided into two types: <strong>APIs</strong> and <strong>blockchain</strong>-<strong>based</strong>.</p>\n<p>Most automated crypto trading is done through APIs. An API is an <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> where you can establish a connection between an account on a cryptocurrency exchange and that of the bot you are using. The software then gains access to your profile and is able to perform buy and sell actions instead of you.</p>\n<p>The other type of automated trading uses <strong>the blockchain</strong> directly. It utilizes the code in <strong>smart contracts</strong> to perform financial activities autonomously. Since Ethereum is the world’s biggest smart contracts platform, most of these types of software reside on this network.</p>\n<p>Automated bots can also be classified into 5 groups:     </p>\n<h3 id=\"arbitrage-bots\">Arbitrage Bots</h3>\n<p>Arbitraged bot trading means buying cheaper on one exchange and selling higher on a different one to take advantage of the price difference and make a profit. This strategy often requires multiple trades back and forth since the margins might be minimal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"coin-lending-bots\">Coin Lending Bots</h3>\n<p>Coin lending bots can automatically lend coins to margin traders on cryptocurrency exchanges, which will eventually be paid back with interest.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"marginleverage-bots\">Margin/Leverage Bots</h3>\n<p>If you can automate the lending process, you can also automate borrowing. Margin bots borrow coins from lenders to execute margin trades instead of humans.</p>\n<h3 id=\"market-making-bots\">Market-Making Bots</h3>\n<p>Market-making bots monitor crypto exchanges to provide liquidity for them. These tools can be configured to submit buy and sell orders above or beyond the asking price. They make a profit by purchasing a little cheaper when the value decreases and selling when the market goes up. </p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-trading-bots\">Technical Trading Bots</h3>\n<p>This type of automated software tries to predict future price trends based on specific signals or indicators. They can even copy and imitate your favorite crypto traders to perform the same market actions as them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-legal-side-of-automated-crypto-trading\">The Legal Side of Automated Crypto Trading</h2>\n<p>But is crypto bot trading legal? Using automated trading software is legal, and the cryptocurrency niche isn’t the only industry that takes advantage of them. They have their use in traditional stock markets, for example: Wall Street relies on various bots when it comes to fiat currency exchanges, bonds, and the equities market. Software is unquestionably faster and more efficient than people.</p>\n<p>Depending on the jurisdiction, local laws and directives might regulate how crypto bots can be used. Not all automated trading software is legit and created with good intentions. Some don’t deliver everything they promise, and others can be plain scams. It’s important to remember that if trading or owning cryptocurrencies is considered illegal in your jurisdiction, the use of automated crypto trading tools can’t be allowed either.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-4-most-popular-platforms-for-automated-crypto-trading\">The 4 Most Popular Platforms for Automated Crypto Trading</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, there is no shortage of crypto bots to choose from. In the segments below, you can read about 4 that are believed to be worth trying out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wundertrading\">WunderTrading</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Wunder_Trading_1645994642.jpg\" alt=\"Wunder Trading\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wundertrading.com/en\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wundertrading.com/en\">WunderTrading</a></strong> is an automated trading bot for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. The software can be coupled with a long list of popular crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and many others.</p>\n<p>The bot can easily be set up and assimilate scripts from TradingView to achieve the best results.

Its mining reward is 12.5 Litecoins per block, and the average block mining time is 2.5 minutes.</p>\n<p>To mine Litecoin, your hardware needs to solve complex mathematical problems known as hashes to obtain the right to record new transactions on the blockchain. You&#39;ll receive 12.5 LTC tokens if you&#39;re the first miner to solve a hash associated with a transaction.</p>\n<p>Mining Litecoin requires massive computing power. That&#39;s why most mining is done by dedicated mining farms or crypto mining pools working with sophisticated hardware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-litecoin-used-for\">What is Litecoin Used For</h2>\n<p>Litecoin is a highly-liquid cryptocurrency, with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens traded daily. Thus, many merchants accept payments in Litecoin because it’s easier to convert to fiat or other cryptocurrencies and vice versa. </p>\n<p>You can also use crypto payment apps like BitPay to pay for services with LTC — the app will convert your tokens to the fiat equivalent. Likewise, you can pay someone with LTC by transferring tokens to their address.</p>\n<h2 id=\"litecoin-halving\">Litecoin Halving</h2>\n<p>To control the supply of Litecoin tokens, the rewards allocated to each mining block cuts in half every four years. When Litecoin first launched, miners received 50 tokens per block. Over a decade later, that number has fallen to 12.5 due to two successive halvings. </p>\n<p>Halvings occur to ensure miners don’t max out the supply of new LTC tokens in a short period. The next LTC halving will take place in 2023. </p>\n<h3 id=\"litecoin-halving-dates\">Litecoin Halving Dates</h3>\n<p>The next Litecoin halving will occur on 30 June 2023. Successive halvings will take place every four years until the supply of LTC tokens hit the maximum of 84 million.</p>\n<h2 id=\"litecoin-vs-bitcoin\">Litecoin vs. Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>The supply of Bitcoin and Litecoin are both capped, the former at 21 million and the latter at 84 million. Litecoin transactions are processed in a quarter of the time as Bitcoin transactions. Because of the difference in transaction speed, Litecoin halves rewards to miners every time 840,000 blocks get mined, while Bitcoin does that for every 210,000 blocks. </p>\n<p>The mining algorithm that Litecoin uses, Scrypt, is newer than what Bitcoin uses, SHA-256. Scrypt doesn&#39;t require as much computing power for mining as Bitcoin&#39;s SHA-256 algorithm.</p>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Litecoin</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Bitcoin</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Maximum supply\n   </td>\n   <td>84 million\n   </td>\n   <td>21 million\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Release date\n   </td>\n   <td>October 7, 2011\n   </td>\n   <td>January 9, 2009\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Average transaction processing time\n   </td>\n   <td>2.5 minutes\n   </td>\n   <td>10 minutes\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Halving interval\n   </td>\n   <td>840,000 blocks\n   </td>\n   <td>210,000 blocks\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Hashing algorithm\n   </td>\n   <td>Scrypt\n   </td>\n   <td>SHA-256\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Blockchain protocol\n   </td>\n   <td>Proof-of-work\n   </td>\n   <td>Proof-of-work\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p>More on the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/litecoin-history-features-and-btc-comparison\">difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-litecoin-a-good-investment\">Is Litecoin a Good Investment?</h2>\n<p>Litecoin is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies. But, it’s not as popular as counterparts like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a token’s popularity correlates with its price. If more people buy Litecoin as a store of value, the price is bound to increase and the opposite happens if fewer people buy it. </p>\n<p>Litecoin is available on almost all major exchanges. However, Litecoin has historically been preferable for everyday transactions instead of a store of value. Merchants prefer it because it’s less volatile than other tokens. Also, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/crypto-legislation-worldwide-explained\">government regulations</a> for cryptocurrencies haven’t yet been decided, and regulatory actions from powerful countries like the United States can sway a token’s price.</p>\n<p>If you want to invest in cryptocurrency as a store of value, you’ll be better off with other digital tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-litecoin\">How to Buy Litecoin</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to purchase Litecoin tokens is through a trusted <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/centralized-vs-decentralized-crypto-exchanges\">centralized or decentralized exchange</a>. Exchanges make it easy for people around the globe to buy and sell coins to each other. You can find a suitable exchange (e.g., ChangeNOW) to buy LTC tokens with fiat or other tokens you own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"steps-to-buy-litecoin\">Steps to buy Litecoin</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Pick a suitable exchange</strong></p>\n<p>There are many exchanges, and it’s up to you to choose one. But, not all of them offer Litecoins, so it’s essential to find one that does. Another important thing to look out for is which fiat currencies the exchange supports. For instance, if you’re based in the US, look for an exchange that supports dollar deposits to make things easier.</p>\n<p>Centralized exchanges perform “know-your-customer (KYC)” verification and different ones have different identification requirements. Decide what type of information you’re comfortable giving out and choose an exchange that suits you. </p>\n<p>Your location also matters. Some exchanges aren’t available in certain countries like the U.S. due to regulations, so pick one that fulfills regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction to avoid problems.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Buy Litecoin</strong></p>\n<p>Once you pick a suitable exchange, you should be able to deposit fiat or other crypto tokens and exchange it for Litecoin. You can fund your account with a debit/credit card, bank transfer, or by transferring tokens from other wallets to a unique address. </p>\n<p>Depending on the exchange you choose, buying Litecoin after depositing funds could be as simple as a click, or you&#39;ll have to look for the LTC ticker and indicate the amount you want to purchase. </p>\n<p>Different exchanges have different <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/cryptocurrency-exchange-fees-explained-what-happens-during-a-crypto-swap\">transaction fees</a> but expect anything between 0.1% and 5%. After completing your purchase, you may own full Litecoins or partial tokens. For instance, if Litecoin is trading at $80 and you invest $40, then you’ll own 0.5 LTC. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Store your Litecoin</strong></p>\n<p>Most exchanges have built-in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/crypto-wallets-and-asset-security\">digital wallets</a> where you can store your tokens including Litecoin. However, some people prefer to store their coins in hardware wallets not connected to the internet for better security.</p>\n<p>Options for storing your Litecoin tokens include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centralized crypto exchanges</strong>: Centralized exchanges can provide a user with a digital wallet to store their tokens and access them at any time if they have the correct credentials.</li>\n<li><strong>Desktop/Mobile wallets</strong>: There are many wallet platforms accessible through a browser extension or mobile and desktop apps that let you store your Litecoin, e.g., NOW Wallet – a non-custodial solution with all the convenience of ChangeNOW, Exodus, or others.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware wallets</strong>: You can use hardware devices to hold the private keys to your crypto assets and use your assets without connecting to the internet. Examples of hardware wallets include Ledger and Trezor.</li>\n<li><strong>Paper wallets</strong>: This method entails printing your private keys and recovery phrases on a piece of paper and storing it somewhere safe. You won’t be able to access your assets if you lose your keys and recovery phrase, so guard it jealously.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There’s an endless list of cryptocurrencies built on different blockchains. Some function better as a store of value, while some are preferable for everyday use. Litecoin is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies, and many merchants accept it for payments. You can acquire Litecoins by buying or mining them, though the latter is much harder. </p>\n<p>Buying Litecoin is just a few steps away on the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW exchange</a>.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":4,"name":"Industry","description":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more. \n\n","slug":"industry","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Industry - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more.

This is why crypto firms invest in sports: fans are loyal to their favorite clubs, and there’s a good chance users will embrace digital coins promoted by their teams. This isn’t the case just for football: crypto firms have invested millions in Super Bowl ads, and the aforementioned Crypto.com paid $700M to rename the basketball Staples Center to Crypto.com Arena in 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_20_FIFA_World_Cup_Themed_Crypto_Token_list_01_1_f587710cb2.png\" alt=\"Fan Tokens and More: What Crypto Offers to Football Fans\" ></p>\n<p>The basic rule of crypto-football integration is active engagement. The leaders in this niche are <a href=\"https://www.socios.com/\">Socios.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/fan-token\">Binance Fan Token Platform</a>: these enterprises partner with football clubs to issue Fan Tokens, digital assets that grant their holders numerous benefits. The perks vary from VIP tickets to participation in clubs’ governance. </p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at the tokens that football fans can leverage. </p>\n<h2 id=\"chiliz--a-new-level-of-fan-engagement\">Chiliz – a New Level of Fan Engagement</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Chiliz_9e92f1b5d2.png\" alt=\"Chiliz\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chiliz.com/en/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Until recently, watching games or buying merchandise were the only ways for fans to interact with their favorite sports teams. With the advent of crypto, fans got the opportunity to actively participate in sports brands’ lives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/chiliz\">Chiliz</a> is an Ethereum-based platform that enables this kind of interaction. With CHZ coin, users can buy Fan Tokens of their favorite sports clubs at Socios.com, a crowd management platform built on top of Chiliz. Each team can customize the experiences that these tokens provide. This way, fans can: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take part in surveys and polls for sports club governance,</li>\n<li>Choose uniform designs and approve new stadium names, </li>\n<li>Vote on celebration songs, </li>\n<li>Help the club decide over the starting lineups and messages worn by captains on their armbands,</li>\n<li>Access exclusive meetings with sportsmen and club-related memorabilia.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is an unprecedented level of fan engagement: users have never been able to influence their favorite sports clubs’ decisions that much. These incentives turn passive fans into active fans – by obtaining a stake in the club, fans get a sense of belonging and want to invest more time and money in it. This helps teams create new revenue streams and monetize their fanbase – it’s not hard to share some of the non-strategic decisions with the community, while the returns pay off. </p>\n<p>Chiliz runs on Ethereum as an ERC20 token and on BSC in BEP20 format. You can buy CHZ on the official Chiliz.net platform or on <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/chiliz\">ChangeNOW</a> without registration and hidden fees. </p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-fan-tokens-work\">How do Fan Tokens work?</h3>\n<p>Here are some facts about the Chiliz-driven sports tokens: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fan Tokens run on the Socios sidechain</strong> secured by the <strong>Proof of Authority</strong> consensus mechanism. This algorithm is considered less secure but is better suited for scalability and speed.  </li>\n<li>Users receive new Fan Tokens during the <strong>Fan Token Offerings (FTOs)</strong> held by sports clubs. Each token has its customized tokenomics: the team defines the initial price, supply, and distribution rules. </li>\n<li>As the team plays in championships, part of <strong>Fan Tokens can be burned following each victory</strong>, which makes them more scarce and thus drives up their price.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Besides Fan Tokens, Chiliz plans to launch a collection of NFTs. The platform partners with Chainlink – a decentralized oracle service that provides smart contracts with live data feed. Together, the platforms will create a <strong>series of NFTs</strong> to commemorate sportsmen’s milestones and team victories. </p>\n<p>Chiliz partners with some of the world’s most renowned sports organizations: UFC, the Golden State Warriors basketball team, and Formula1 (Aston Martin Cognizant team). But football clubs take a special position among Chiliz partnerships – the platform has issued fan tokens for Paris Saint-Germain FC, Manchester City, and FC Barcelona. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, three <a href=\"https://www.fanmarketcap.com/\">largest</a> Fan Tokens by market cap were created by another project – Binance Fan Token Platform. These include Santos FC, S.S. Lazio, and FC Porto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"santos-fc-fan-token\">Santos FC Fan Token</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/SANTOS_e3463ace27.png\" alt=\"SANTOS\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/santos-fc-fan-token/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/santos-fc-fan-token\">SANTOS</a> is the largest fan token among not only football-related, but all sports assets. It <a href=\"https://www.fanmarketcap.com/\">tops</a> the list with a $53-million market cap (by a large margin from number two) and demonstrates $42 million of daily trading volume. Santos FC Fan Token ranks 335th among all cryptocurrencies in general. </p>\n<p>But FC Santos is a record holder not only in terms of Fan Token market data. Since 1912, the club has raised such top football players as Neymar, Rodrygo, and Pelé – the latter is still considered the greatest footballer of all time. He played for Santos for the most part of his life and scored over 500 goals. The club has won the national Brasileirão league for 8 times and keeps the record of winning 24 titles in just 10 years. </p>\n<p>Santos FC Fan Token was launched in November 2021 in partnership between the club and Binance Launchpool. The platform has become the sponsor and got the license to issue the club NFTs. For Binance, this partnership was the opportunity to attract new customers, and for Santos – a great way to raise fan engagement.</p>\n<p>FC Santos Fan Token offers a number of privileges. Its owners can: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participate in voting sessions on Binance Fan Token Platform.</li>\n<li>Get access to Santos BC NFT, which can be used to receive fan rewards. </li>\n<li>Pay for match tickets, merchandise, and club membership through Binance Pay. </li>\n<li>Access private club events – meetings with the team, autograph sessions, and merchandise signing. The Fan Token also allows its holders to see the club’s life from the inside by visiting training sessions. </li>\n<li>Participate in gamified fan activities on Binance Fan Token Platform.</li>\n<li>Donate to the club and receive the “proof-of-loyalty badge” in return. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ss-lazio-fan-token\">S.S.

A €30-million deal with the club is to last for two years with an option to extend it. As the S.S. Lazio President Claudio Lotito said, “_this partnership will allow us to extend our digital presence and connect with our fans and followers from all over the world like never before._”</p>\n<p>S.S. Lazio is a Rome-based Italian football club with a rich history. It has won national championships multiple times, and also has had the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup and UEFA Super Cup. </p>\n<p>LAZIO is the second-largest fan token: its market cap reaches $28 million, and the daily trading volume is above $8 million. Here’s what its owners can enjoy: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voting rights for club decisions – for instance, regarding the message on the captain’s armband. </li>\n<li>Unique club rewards. </li>\n<li>Exclusive access to the player area, rights to watch games in the VIP zone, discounts for the team merchandise. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>S.S. Lazio and Binance are also planning to grant Fan Token holders with loyalty subscriptions, NFT collections, and fan shop integrations. </p>\n<h2 id=\"fc-porto-fan-token\">FC Porto Fan Token</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/PORTO_49a3ffa5f3.png\" alt=\"PORTO\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/ru/currencies/fc-porto/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/fc-porto-fan-token\">PORTO</a> is a Fan Token of FC Porto – the second-richest football club in Portugal famous for its huge fanbase. The token is ranking 3rd with $27 million of market cap and $18 million of trading volume. The team is a Portuguese Premier League member and has signed a multi-year contract with Binance to issue a Fan Token. </p>\n<p>The opportunities that PORTO offers to its owners are similar to those of Santos and Lazio: users gain access to club NFTs, meet-and-greets and signed merchandise, can choose club anthems and donate tokens to the team. </p>\n<p>At the time of writing, Binance Fan Token Platform <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/fan-token/team-profile/porto?ref=IUZLK8ZG&amp;utm_source=fan-token&amp;utm_medium=porto-cmc&amp;utm_campaign=porto-cmc\">offers</a> one active voting poll for Porto: Token holders can choose the player of the month. Currently, Mehdi Taremi tops the leaderboard with 285 votes. The recently ended polls include choosing <em>“where an FC Porto Athlete should surprise stadium and museum visitors”</em> (users voted for “at the pitch” option) and “<em>which sports practice session you will like to watch on @FCPortoSports Instagram stories</em>” (basketball). </p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>You can purchase all mentioned tokens including <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/chiliz\">Chiliz</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/santos-fc-fan-token\">Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ss-lazio-fan-token-bsc\">Lazio</a>, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/fc-porto-fan-token\">Porto</a>, on ChangeNOW without registration and hidden fees.

Issues such as fraud, corruption, or the mismanagement of funds have all happened in the past, proving centralized systems to be somewhat unreliable.</p>\n<p>DeFi is the answer to government-controlled financial institutions. Decentralized finance is based on blockchain technology that allows anyone to keep independent records of the status of all transactions. This effectively solves the problems revolving around single points of failure, puts users in control of their own money, and gets rid of intermediaries and middlemen. Thanks to DeFi, cryptocurrencies can now penetrate more perfected financial markets and widen their use cases.</p>\n<p>Decentralized Finance services operate independently of a central authority. There isn’t a company or person in charge of DeFi platforms. They rely on cryptocurrencies that are based on smart contracts and can perform programmable tasks. That allows crypto users to build a whole ecosystem of decentralized exchanges and platforms for lending and borrowing money.</p>\n<p>DeFi takes advantage of the Ethereum blockchain&#39;s strengths to develop and run all its decentralized apps and services. Ethereum is the biggest network of smart contracts which holds the codebase and rules that indicate how a specific app is supposed to work. The code is the rule in Ethereum. Once a smart contract of a decentralized app or service is released to the blockchain, no single entity has any control of it anymore. It becomes autonomous and irreversible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_31_Academy_2_De_Fi_and_Passive_Income_from_Crypto_02_06ecf042c9.png\" alt=\"DeFi &amp; Passive Income from Crypto\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-history-of-defi\">The History of DeFi</h2>\n<p>Let’s go back in time to understand how the DeFi movement was born. Bitcoin was created in 2009. Some readers might wonder, why not simply use Bitcoin as the backbone of the decentralized financial industry? Well, Bitcoin’s language is simply not suitable to run dApps. However, the coin prompted other developers to create more robust infrastructure, such as that of Ethereum, in 2015.</p>\n<p>Ethereum was used as a foundation to create a decentralized lending platform Maker DAO, one of the first major DeFi projects. Maker DAO is considered to have laid the groundwork for the future of the DeFi industry. In 2017, we witnessed the creation of EtherDelta, a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on the Ethereum blockchain. This DEX facilitated trades between ERC-20 tokens and ether.</p>\n<p>During the 2017/2018 ICO era, several DeFi platforms were created. They are still popular today. Those are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AAVE – a lending and borrowing app</li>\n<li>Synthetix – a derivatives liquidity protocol initially known as Havven</li>\n<li>0x – a P2P token exchange and liquidity aggregator</li>\n<li>Bancor – a decentralized exchange</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During that period, developers learned that it was easier for people to interact with smart contracts and use platforms that pooled together all the money of its users instead of having them deal with each other in a P2P manner. This interaction model was better suited for DeFi. </p>\n<p>One such network that was created in 2018 was Uniswap. Users of this platform interacted with liquidity pools rather than with individual traders. During 2018/2019, a few other networks were launched in the DeFi space, such as Compound, Ren, and Kyber Network.</p>\n<p>The summer of 2020 was the period when decentralized finance protocols soared. It began with Compound creating a liquidity mining program, where users were rewarded with COMP tokens for lending and borrowing digital assets. Compound incentivized other development teams to get involved, like Yearn Finance. Its native token (YFI) was listed at $6 on Uniswap and rose with incredible momentum to over $30.000 in just two months. This is how the “DeFi summer” kicked off.</p>\n<p>We then witnessed the introduction of Ampleforth algorithmic stablecoin and Sushiswap decentralized exchange. In September 2020, Uniswap hosted a massive airdrop that rewarded all its users with 400 UNI tokens worth over $1,200. This sparked new interest in the platform as the monthly trading volume of Uniswap increased from $200 million at the beginning of 2020 to $15 billion in September 2020. After some ups and downs, the year 2020 <a href=\"https://defillama.com/\">ended</a> with over $15 billion worth of digital assets locked up in various DeFi platforms. </p>\n<p>But the explosive growth of DeFi in 2020 was just the beginning. The total amount of value locked in all protocols continued to increase through 2021 and reached a whopping $181 billion in December. New protocols emerged every day and offered improved mechanics and liquidity mining programs, which is why they were dubbed DeFi 2.0. Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum and new layer-1 blockchains made transactions cheaper and faster, and cross-chain bridges made it easy to move funds across different platforms.</p>\n<p>2022 was starting well, despite a slight decline in users’ activity. But then the human factor failed DeFi enthusiasts: the notorious Anchor protocol couldn’t maintain an ultra-high APR and decreased it, Terra’s stablecoin UST crashed, and a huge market crisis was triggered. In just one month, the total value of all DeFi protocols halved and stands at the $55 billion mark now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-elements-of-a-decentralized-financial-system\">The Elements of a Decentralized Financial System</h2>\n<h3 id=\"stablecoins\">Stablecoins</h3>\n<p>A decentralized financial system needs a stable currency to preserve and exchange value. We can’t use Bitcoins because they aren’t operational on the Ethereum blockchain. Ether (ETH) is too volatile for this goal. Stablecoins, on the other hand, are perfect tools because they are pegged to the actual value of fiat currencies like the USD.</p>\n<p>One of the most widely used stablecoins in DeFi is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tether-erc20\">Tether (USDT)</a> – but it’s managed by a centralized entity and is not fully suitable for a decentralized economy. One of the alternatives is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dai\">DAI</a>, a decentralized stablecoin that is backed by cryptocurrencies instead of fiat money. The value of collateral behind DAI greatly exceeds its own one – this overcollateralized nature acts as protection against market volatility and sudden price drops. DAI can be purchased on exchanges, or you can borrow it in the MakerDAO protocol.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decentralized-exchanges-dexes\">Decentralized exchanges (DEXes)</h3>\n<p>The second element of DeFi is decentralized exchanges. These platforms operate on the Ethereum blockchain and allow traders to buy and sell digital assets based on the rules laid out in the underlying smart contracts.</p>\n<p>DEXes have several advantages over centralized exchanges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no need to register, submit identifiable personal information or undergo KYC verification.</li>\n<li>DEXes don’t require withdrawal fees which can amount to up to $50 when using centralized platforms.</li>\n<li>There are no geographical restrictions or banned countries because DEXes are available globally.</li>\n<li>The users trade directly from their Ethereum wallets, limiting the potential of losing money if the exchange gets hacked or exit scams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s examine the most popular ways to make money using DeFi services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yield-farming\">Yield Farming</h2>\n<p>One of the ways to take advantage of the DeFi space is being involved in yield farming. Farmers deposit their cryptocurrencies in liquidity pools. Those assets are then borrowed by other users while the lenders earn yield for the provided liquidity.</p>\n<p>The earliest and most lucrative yield farming opportunities were provided by Compound Finance. It’s a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing various cryptocurrencies. Similar to the stablecoin DAI, Compound is also overcollateralized. All lenders earn interest from the borrowers for lending them their coins. But <strong>borrowers</strong> receive an additional incentive in the form of COMP tokens for borrowing from the platform. The COMP tokens&#39; value made it cheaper to borrow crypto assets because the more you borrowed, the more COMP you would earn. As time progressed, COMP became more valuable than the initially borrowed coins, so users kept borrowing even more.</p>\n<p>Since the demand for Compound Finance kept increasing, the interest rates for <strong>lenders</strong> went up as well. Besides the yield they earned from the interest rates, lenders were also rewarded with COMP tokens. The real magic started when lenders were allowed to take loans based on the crypto they already deposited as liquidity. The new loans were lent again, earning even more interest and additional COMP tokens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"liquidity-providers\">Liquidity Providers</h2>\n<p>Providing liquidity to trading pools allows users to earn interest when their assets facilitate exchanges between different ERC-20 tokens. Some of the popular brands in this niche include Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, and Synthetix. Protocols running on other blockchains are also highly popular due to lower fees and greater transaction speed – for instance, PancakeSwap on BNB Smart Chain or SocialSwap on TRON.</p>\n<p>A liquidity provider usually allocates two tokens in equal proportion creating a trading pair between those two assets. ETH/BAT is an example of a liquidity pool that consists of ether and Basic Attention Token. The lender’s interest is to allocate equal amounts of each token so that the initial price doesn’t rise/fall, creating arbitrage opportunities for other traders. Arbitrage trading would result in the loss of revenue for the lender.</p>\n<p>The person who provides liquidity is called an LP. These users receive LP tokens  for their services proportionally to the amount of liquidity they provided. When an exchange occurs involving a trading pair an LP allocated liquidity to, the lender receives a percentage of the trading fees. To withdraw the initial assets, the LP needs to burn their LP tokens.</p>\n<p>Each performed trade adjusts the price of the underlying tokens depending on the quantity that was exchanged. The technical term for this feature is Automated Market Maker or AMM. If a user purchases ether from an ETH/BAT liquidity pool, they automatically lower the total supply of ETH and increase BAT. That positively affects the value of ETH but lowers the price for BAT. The price movement depends on the liquidity allocated to the pool and the size of the facilitated trade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"staking\">Staking</h2>\n<p>Staking allows users to earn crypto rewards simply by storing their coins in suitable wallets or exchanges.</p>\n<p>In Proof of Stake blockchains like <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/the-merge-explained-one-step-closer-to-scalable-ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, staking is used to secure the network. A person who wants to hold a stake has to freeze their funds for a certain period, and then they are allowed to validate blocks. The larger the stake, the higher the probability of being selected as a validator.</p>\n<p>In DeFi, staking is different – it’s neither the means to secure the network nor the way to ensure consensus. In decentralized finance, staking helps projects improve their tokenomics: if users don’t sell an asset and lock it in the blockchain, that helps maintain that token’s price. Obviously, users are rewarded for freezing their coins.</p>\n<p>One of the opportunities of this kind is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/tokens/now-staking\">NOW Token staking.</a> If you <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/now-token\">own</a><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span>some NOW, you can lock it in your wallet in a few clicks and start earning up to a 25% APR with rewards coming weekly. The minimum amount for staking is just 10 NOW. The longer you stake, the higher will be your reward. </p>\n<p>Another popular option is staking LP tokens – those that represent your share in a liquidity pool after you put your funds in it. Staked LP tokens incentivize users to continue providing liquidity to pools, thus maintaining the stability of the protocol. As an example, you can stake LP tokens on BSC-based PancakeSwap and earn the platform&#39;s native CAKE tokens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"liquid-staking\">Liquid staking</h3>\n<p>As Ethereum switched to the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, ETH staking was introduced. But solo staking requires tech skills and 32 ether, so developers created the services where it is possible to stake a smaller sum.</p>\n<p>One of these solutions is Lido protocol. Its main advantage is that when you lock your ETH in the platform, it sends you the equivalent amount of stETH (staked ether) tokens that you can freely use. This way the value of your ETH is not completely frozen, and you can leverage it in DeFi or other domains of the crypto market. </p>\n<h2 id=\"airdrops\">Airdrops</h2>\n<p>An airdrop is a marketing activity where developers send out a new token to crypto users’ addresses. Tokens are given away to promote a project and get the community interested in the issues that the particular currency is trying to solve. Airdrops are an easy way to earn some crypto, hoping that the coin might one day experience a good price swing in your favor. Moreover, some airdropped tokens offer utility or governance opportunities to their owners.</p>\n<p>In its most simple form, an airdrop would require you to submit a receiving address that will eventually be topped up by some free tokens. But airdrops have evolved in recent years, and they now need some additional information. This marketing strategy is beneficial to token creators as well, not just the receivers. Interested parties are often required to fill out a form where they need to submit their emails and social media profiles. In many cases, users need to follow or like Twitter and Facebook pages of the projects and complete simple tasks like retweeting and commenting on posts. In exchange for free coins, the developers receive an extensive database of potential new investors and customers.</p>\n<p>To receive an airdrop, you need an ERC-20-compatible wallet such as <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a> or MetaMask. Airdrops can be found via social media and crypto-related media sites. Ensure that you never hand out sensitive information like private keys, which could result in the loss of funds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>DeFi has enabled cryptocurrency holders to earn interest on their digital assets in several different ways. To almost 1.4 billion people worldwide who don’t possess a bank account, decentralized services offer financial independence.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to get involved in DeFi is to use lending and borrowing platforms to farm yield and allocate funds to liquidity pools, creating trading opportunities for others. Users are then rewarded with a percentage of the fees and in some cases, with platform’s native tokens. These earnings can be staked to increase income. It is also possible to stake ETH in liquid staking protocols and use stETH tokens to leverage other DeFi opportunities. Lastly, users can take advantage of airdrops to increase their stock of digital assets.</p>\n<p>New decentralized financial opportunities are created every day. It will be fascinating to see how far up the ladder DeFi can go.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Ex editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T17:20:50.693Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-11-08T16:54:44.289Z","createdAt":"2022-11-08T15:57:09.082Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-08T16:54:44.309Z"},{"id":1333,"title":"What is Bitcoin Cash and What's Its Difference vs Bitcoin","description":"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a proof-of-work blockchain network and cryptocurrency.

Despite the difference between <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and Bitcoin Cash, both of these networks use the same consensus mechanism and have 21 million coins hard cap. Being decentralized, Bitcoin Cash doesn&#39;t rely on any central authority like a government or financial institutions. </p>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash appeared in August of 2017 as a solution to Bitcoin’s transaction speed and scalability issues, offering a faster and cheaper way to process payments. This was possible because of Bitcoin blockchain hard fork – a process that means splitting of the network in two at a certain block. After forks some participants continue to operate under the rules they used before, while the others branch off and generate a new blockchain with an updated software setup, often with its own cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_24_what_is_bitcoin_cash_eaa624bd7f.png\" alt=\"what is bitcoin cash\" ></p>\n<p>It all started from a disagreement between those believing in the potential of Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin’s adherents. The decision to fork was made by miners and developers who hoped that it would help them get rid of the blockchain limitations. The idea was to change the rules and allow Bitcoin to process a greater volume of transactions, increasing the size of the blocks within the blockchain. </p>\n<p>Other participants of the network couldn&#39;t agree it was the right decision. They pointed to Bitcoin Cash having larger blocks, meaning a more complex mining process. This could be a real problem for those miners who didn&#39;t have enough computer power. In addition, this could centralize the platform among the most prominent miners, for example, corporations that can afford the most power for mining.</p>\n<p>As a result of this disagreement, two blockchain paths with a common origin were created. Those who owned Bitcoin at the time of the fork received an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. Despite the fact that this is a common phenomenon in hard forks, some people express the opinion that this was done for the quick enrichment of certain participants.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It felt almost like the fracturing of a religion. Miners had to decide which chain to allocate their efforts toward, exchanges had to decide whether or not to support trading of this newly forked currency, and market participants had to decide whether they had any interest in the new currency and what its fair price should be.”</p>\n<p>Henrik Gebbing, co-founder and co-CEO of Finoa</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash eventually had its own forks in November 2018. It was split into Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) and Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). Bitcoin Cash ABC in a way is more developer-centric and allows for reinvesting 8% of every block reward into innovating the network. In 2021, BCHA rebranded to eCash (XEC). </p>\n<p>Bitcoin SV, in turn, is focused on ensuring stability by providing blocks larger than Bitcoin Cash. It has reached over 9,000 transactions per second and even placed an estimated 16.4 million transactions in one block in early 2021 on the platform&#39;s scaling test network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-bitcoin-cash-work\">How Does Bitcoin Cash Work?</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash works very similarly to Bitcoin. Proof-of-work algorithm allows miners to confirm and add transactions utilizing computer power, and be rewarded in Bitcoin Cash tokens for their contributions. The network works on Bitcoin Cash Node – a blockchain created to enable users transacting in BCH.</p>\n<p>As blocks are groups of transactions added to the blockchain at the same time, it is logical for BCH to operate faster because of the larger block size. Bitcoin Cash block size amounted to 8 MB initially and expanded later to 32 MB, allowing it to process over 100 transactions per second and have low fees. </p>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash supports tokens, smart contracts, and private payments with tools like CashShuffle and CashFusion – the most popular dApps within its ecosystem. CashShuffle is a coin mixing protocol that some BCH holders use in certain wallets. It shuffles Bitcoin Cash with other holders’ coins before the transaction, making it much more difficult to track.</p>\n<p>What matters here is that coin mixing isn’t always reliable. This process requires users to trust a third-party service, which, in turn, contradicts the idea of the autonomy of a cryptosystem. In addition, mixing can cost a fee, and that is not always suitable for those who make transactions frequently. Finally, funds coming to mixing platforms may come to the attention of jurisdictions that doubt the legality of such operations.</p>\n<p>CashFusion, in turn, doesn’t mix transactions, but puts BCH into one large transaction that other CashFusion users have access to, and then sends this BCH back to the wallet. The exception is when a transaction is mixed up and combined with so many other transactions that no one can track the path to the user&#39;s assets. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-bitcoin-cash-used-for\">What Is Bitcoin Cash Used For?</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash is designed as a peer-to-peer payment method, and – being accepted by many merchants – it has several use cases.</p>\n<p>It is available as a payment for e-commerce transactions, and purchased via PayPal as well. Bitcoin Cash can be used to pay participating merchants for goods and services in-store and online. Because of its low fees and fast transactions, Bitcoin Cash is effective for micro-transaction use cases like tipping content creators and rewarding app users.</p>\n<p>Some merchants offer discounts when paying in BCH, as this eliminates the commission from credit cards and helps to expand the implementation of this payment system. Using BCH as a currency also reduces the fees and settlement times for remittances and cross-border trade. </p>\n<p>Developers can issue new tokens that live on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain using the Simple Ledger Protocol. It is similar to how ERC-20 tokens live on the Ethereum blockchain. For example, Tether, the largest issuer of USD stablecoins, has issued USDT tokens that live on the Bitcoin Cash chain that enables people to send and receive USDT with a 1¢ transaction fee using a non-custodial digital wallet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-whats-the-difference\">Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin. What&#39;s the difference?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Bitcoin cash would be better for something like a cup of coffee, while a larger purchase, such as a car or house, may warrant a slower and more secure cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.”</p>\n<p>Daniel R. Hill, president of Hill Wealth Strategies in Virginia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"key-differences-between-bitcoin-cash-and-bitcoin\">Key differences between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin Cash has a larger maximum block size than Bitcoin. It increases the volume of transactions – up to 200 transactions per second vs Bitcoin&#39;s only 7. Bitcoin Cash transactions cost less than a penny, while median on-chain Bitcoin transaction fee is in the range of $1-15 ($1.325 at the time of writing)</li>\n<li>Transactions in BTC can be canceled or double-spent using the Replace-by-fee method. BCH protocol doesn&#39;t imply such a mechanism, and that makes Bitcoin Cash more secure. The convention here is that technically it is still possible to double-spend a Bitcoin Cash transaction. But doing so would require collusion with miners and/or bribing miners to accept a second transaction over the first by attaching a very high transaction fee.</li>\n<li>Bitcoin Cash protocol supports Schnorr signatures – a digital signature scheme that allows for more complex signing capabilities. Transactions that adopt Schnorr signatures consume less space, therefore are less expensive. When there is widespread adoption of Schnorr signatures, the network&#39;s privacy has the potential to enhance by improving the fungibility of tokens.</li>\n<li>Bitcoin Cash uses a difficulty adjustment algorithm helping to ensure new blocks are generated at a stable rate every 10 minutes, even if there is high price volatility and hash power elasticity. It means that if some miners move their hashing power from BTC to BCH and back, Bitcoin Cash&#39;s difficulty adjustment algorithm ensures blocks continue to be produced at the desired consistent rate. Bitcoin’s difficulty of mining is automatically adjusted approximately every two weeks in order to ensure the total blocking time remains at the level of 10 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"advantages-of-bitcoin-cash\">Advantages of Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p><strong>Fast and cheap transactions.</strong> Bitcoin Cash can become a viable payment platform with transaction costs of less than 1 cent and the ability to process more than 100 transactions per second. But while Visa processes 2000 TPS, Bitcoin Cash still has something to strive for.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralization of assets.</strong> Bitcoin Cash system is decentralized and not controlled by any person or group of entities. It means much if you worry about centralized control from banks and central </p>\n<p>governments.</p>\n<p><strong>Scalability.</strong> Increased scalability of a blockchain is provided by larger blocks of Bitcoin Cash that results in lower fees for users, hence it is more transactable.</p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility.</strong> Bitcoin Cash is one of the most popular among thousands of existing cryptocurrencies, and, unlike lesser-known competitors, it can be purchased on most major exchanges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disadvantages-of-bitcoin-cash\">Disadvantages of Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p><strong>Security.</strong> The downside to processing transactions more quickly is that it’s potentially less secure than Bitcoin. There is less mining power needed to process and confirm transactions, which could make it easier for the Bitcoin Cash security to be compromised.</p>\n<p><strong>Rate of adoption.</strong> Bitcoin Cash struggles to strengthen its position as an accepted investment and medium of exchange, still being used by fewer people compared to Bitcoin. But adoption of users is a very important factor, overlooked often because of focusing on processing time  and security.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The success of any type of network, currency or technology depends on the users using it.”</p>\n<p>Russell Star, head of capital markets at DeFi Technologies</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Branding.</strong> It was hard for Bitcoin Cash to distinguish itself in a battle over which coin would become more popular after the fork. Sharing such a similar name, Bitcoin has been the clear winner.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental impact.</strong> Bitcoin Cash is a proof-of-work blockchain, meaning miners must use considerable energy to solve cryptographic equations to process transactions by computers. So it still comes at a high environmental cost even considering that Bitcoin Cash uses less electricity than Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-bitcoin-cash-a-good-investment\">Is Bitcoin Cash a Good Investment?</h2>\n<p>When buying Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin, it should be understood whether you are looking for a long-term investment or something that can be used for transactions.</p>\n<p>Despite the larger block size of Bitcoin Cash and the throughput of transactions aimed at helping it become accepted as a form of payment, the cryptocurrency has so far experienced volatility and has not yet become widespread among consumers.</p>\n<p><em>“When measured in BTC, the price of BCH has fallen steadily since its inception. It stands to reason that the original Bitcoin should serve as a safer investment. If choosing a blockchain to transact with, though, BCH is accepted in many of the same places that accept BTC, and can be used for near-zero fees due to the larger block size and the lesser utilization of that chain,”</em> – said Henrik Gebbing.</p>\n<p><em>“Anyone considering investing in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash should consider whether they can stomach a volatile asset class, which is what crypto is.”</em> – warns Russell Star.</p>\n<p>Although the concept behind Bitcoin Cash has some potential, it has still not achieved its lofty goal of replacing Bitcoin, so BCH must gain momentum as a more acceptable medium of exchange.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash represents a fundamental redesign of the very nature of money and inspired many protocols and other projects, which expands the technology and makes it more accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p><em>This article is for informational purposes only and is not to be considered financial, legal, or investment advice.

As the fastest, sharded Proof-of-Stake chain with superb infrastructure and developer experiences, NEAR has all the tools to become the next DeFi powerhouse,</em>&quot; says N^2, the pseudonymous founder of Bastion decentralized lending protocol built on NEAR.</p>\n<p>What is NEAR Protocol’s main difference from other dApp networks? It is definitely its inherent scalability. <strong>The key element of the NEAR architecture is sharding:</strong> the blockchain is divided into segments that run in parallel, each with its own set of validators. Network’s nodes only have to process a small share of all NEAR transactions – they don’t have to run the whole blockchain at once, which reduces their workload and <strong>leaves room for scalability:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>NEAR Protocol’s average block time is 1.15s;</li>\n<li>Gas fees are less than a penny, </li>\n<li>Transactions are finalized within 1-2 seconds, </li>\n<li>NEAR is expected to process about 100,000 transactions per second once fully developed. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another side of NEAR Protocol’s efficiency is that it was designed as a carbon-neutral blockchain. Proof of Stake-based NEAR <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/climate-neutral-cryptos-vs-bitcoin-how-green-is-the-future\">generates</a> 200,000 times less CO2 than Bitcoin does and sponsors reforestation projects across the globe. </p>\n<p>The blockchain was conceived in late 2018 by engineers who had previously worked at Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Two of the team members had won a world’s coding championship. </p>\n<p>NEAR is a popular coin ranking #28 by market cap. The asset is trading at numerous crypto exchange platforms, including ChangeNOW. If you’ve ever wondered how to buy NEAR Protocol, check out our <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/near\">website</a> and see what rates we offer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-rise-of-the-near-ecosystem\">The Rise of the NEAR Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>In the spring of 2021, developers launched the cross-chain Rainbow bridge – this enabled easy transfer of Ethereum assets to the NEAR blockchain and back. Three months later, Aurora, an EVM-compatible layer-2 solution, allowed everyone to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts in the NEAR ecosystem. </p>\n<p>These two events laid the ground for an explosive growth of the NEAR ecosystem. We’re not here to make a bullish NEAR Protocol price prediction, but just look at these numbers: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>In July 2022, the total number of projects building on NEAR <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol/status/1549391679332941825\">exceeded</a> 700. This <a href=\"https://awesomenear.com/projects\">includes</a> protocols deployed on Aurora and Octopus Network, blockchains operating on top of NEAR. </li>\n<li>According to the non-commercial NEAR Foundation, the network handles from 300,000 to 400,000 transactions daily. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/Near\">DeFiLlama</a> estimates that the total value locked in the NEAR Protocol is about $261 million, not including $145 million locked in Aurora.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the ecosystem grows, NEAR Protocol embraces stablecoins. In April 2022, developers launched an algorithmic USD-pegged stablecoin USN backed by the NEAR coin. In a stablecoin crisis sparked by the TerraUSD collapse this May, the biggest depeg that USN experienced was a drop down to $0.96 tackled within several hours. Another stablecoin that announced joining NEAR in September 2022 was Tether (USDT). </p>\n<p>The rapid rise of the NEAR ecosystem is heavily backed by non-commercial funding and investments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last year, it was announced at an annual NEARCON conference that an <strong>$800 million</strong> fund would be created to sponsor developers building on NEAR. </li>\n<li>In April 2022, NEAR closed a <strong>$350 million</strong> funding round led by Tiger Global, FTX Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, and the others. </li>\n<li>In September 2022, NEAR Foundation launched a $100 million fund and a venture lab to support Web3 projects. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, let’s review 10 projects that will give you the best picture of the NEAR ecosystem today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aurora--evm-compatible-layer-2\">Aurora – EVM-compatible Layer-2</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_5_e84f2f8afe.png\" alt=\"Aurora\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/aurora-dev/99948593-918b-4a88-85ec-b638eb07e319\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>NEAR itself isn’t EVM-compatible – so it’s not possible to easily deploy a smart contract, dApp, or token from Ethereum or BSC on NEAR. Meanwhile, this feature is a must for a network that wants to quickly gain traction in the Web3 segment.</p>\n<p>Aurora layer-2 solution has changed this – now, any protocol can easily migrate to the NEAR ecosystem and enjoy low fees and scalability in a familiar interface. Such major protocols as 1inch and Curve have already been deployed in Aurora, and the blockchain’s TVL has reached $146 million by September 2022. The network hosts about 200 dApps and is governed by AuroraDAO. The increasing activity in Aurora is definitely something that gives bullish impetus to the NEAR coin price prediction. </p>\n<p>In February 2022, the activity in Aurora surged so much that it congested the NEAR network, and developers had to introduce a small gas fee in previously gas-less Aurora. It turned out that 80% of all transactions were made by the users of a recently launched game Moonflower Farmers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bastion--lending\">Bastion – Lending</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_6_97c3b283b8.png\" alt=\"Bastion\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/18533940-Bastion-Protocol-Logo-Redesign\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bastionprotocol.com\">Bastion</a> is the largest protocol built on Aurora with $76 million of total value locked. This lending platform offers a balanced approach to asset management, algorithmic risk optimization, and great UX. As a NEAR-based platform, it pleases users with ultra-low gas fees, fast transactions, and increased capital efficiency. </p>\n<p>In 2022, Bastion received an unknown amount of investment money from several parties. Those included Illia Polosukhin, the co-founder of NEAR, and Jane Street – one of the world’s largest market makers with a yearly $17 trillion volume of futures trading. This round helped Bastion experience “explosive growth” with $200 million being locked in just 24 hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mynearwallet\">MyNearWallet</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_7_24364cb19f.png\" alt=\"MyNearWallet\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.mynearwallet.com/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mynearwallet.com/\">MyNearWallet</a> is a wallet for the NEAR ecosystem with a user-friendly flow. It allows users to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store and exchange all NEAR-based tokens. If you’re considering where to buy NEAR Protocol within the ecosystem, MyNearWallet is a good option.</li>\n<li>Interact with 700+ NEAR dApps. </li>\n<li>Stake NEAR at a 10% APY.</li>\n<li>Store tokens via Ledger wallet. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>MyNearWallet is non-custodial and doesn’t collect any identifying information about its customers. To start using the wallet, you need to create an anonymous account – a convenient profile with a human-readable NEAR address that will allow you to easily navigate the NEAR ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ref-finance--decentralized-exchange\">Ref Finance – Decentralized Exchange</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_8_cf9cbc9bdd.png\" alt=\"Ref.finance\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://guide.ref.finance/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ref.finance/\">Ref.finance</a> is the largest decentralized exchange in the NEAR ecosystem. It leverages the AMM model with liquidity pools, including those for stablecoins: StableSwap feature lets users trade USD-pegged assets the same way as in Curve and earn interest in stablecoins. </p>\n<p>Ref.finance was created by Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, and financed with a grant from the NEAR Foundation. Besides basic functionality like providing liquidity and staking LP tokens, Ref.finance offers higher rewards for staking its native token REF, and users can also participate in decision-making through DAO. </p>\n<p>The total value locked in Ref.finance is about $231 million.</p>\n<h2 id=\"burrow-cash--lending-and-liquid-staking\">Burrow Cash – Lending and Liquid Staking</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_1_2712fb275b.jpg\" alt=\"Burrow\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://quangan.vn/burrowcash-launched-the-turning-point-of-borrowing-and-lending-platform-on-near/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.burrow.cash/\">Burrow Cash</a> is a decentralized lending platform based on the NEAR blockchain. In addition to standard features like taking a loan against a collateral, Burrow offers liquid staking functionality. </p>\n<p>Let’s say you want to stake NEAR or USN and earn staking rewards. In a typical scenario, you would have to lock the coins, meaning that it wouldn’t be possible to use them for a while. With Burrow, you can take profit of the staked coins: the protocol issues synthetic tokens against staked assets (i.e. stNEAR – staked NEAR), which you can use to take a crypto loan or create a leveraged staking position.</p>\n<p>Is NEAR Protocol a good investment? ChangeNOW doesn’t give financial advice, but we do say that Burrow gives you the means to diversify your investment strategy with NEAR coins.</p>\n<p>Burrow rewards users’ activity by distributing its native BRRR tokens. The amount of deposited funds on Burrow reaches $38 million; users have borrowed about $7 million.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roketo--time-distributed-token-streams\">Roketo – Time-Distributed Token Streams</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_9_365aebb8b1.png\" alt=\"Roketo\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/roketostream\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.roke.to\">Roketo</a> is a NEAR-based platform that allows persistent, time-distributed token transfers. Here’s how this works: once you launch a token stream by setting an amount and a duration, funds start gradually accumulating in the receiver’s account. You can pause, resume, and stop the stream at any moment, and the recipient always sees how much money has been accrued. </p>\n<p>Such a dosed distribution of funds works perfectly for the following use cases: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated recurring payrolls. If your team is paid with crypto, you can create a single stream that will deliver salary for as long as you want. This way, you won’t have to manually send dozens of transactions every month. </li>\n<li>Fair pay-per-minute services. With Roketo, customers can pay precisely for the time they’ve been using a service: car parking, equipment rental, or a subscription.</li>\n<li>Airdrops with reduced token volatility. Once an airdrop of a new token occurs, users often sell it right away, thus dumping the price. If the drop is distributed by a few months, this helps avoid quick sales and consequent volatility. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"coinpipe--crypto-for-businesses\">CoinPipe – Crypto for Businesses</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2_8c6eaffb66.jpg\" alt=\"CoinPipe\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoinpipeFinancehttps://twitter.com/CoinpipeFinance\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>If you run a business and want to accept cryptocurrency as payment, <a href=\"https://coinpipe.finance/\">CoinPipe</a> is a solution.

Bitcoin added 4% to its value and surpassed the $20,000 mark. </p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-crypto-up\">Why Is Crypto Up?</h2>\n<p>Why is crypto going up today? The first reason comes from the UK torn by an economic crisis. <strong>The new British Prime Minister who took office today is a proponent of crypto</strong> – when Rishi Sunak was Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) under PM Johnson, he said he would <strong>turn Great Britain into a global crypto hub</strong>. The crypto experts who worked with Sunak in previous years hailed his appointment today. </p>\n<p>During his tenure as finance minister, Sunak introduced the Financial Services and Markets Bill with the UK economic strategy. And here’s the second answer to the question “why is crypto up today?” – on October 25, the lower house of the British parliament voted to recognize crypto as “regulated financial instruments” in this bill. This means that <strong>the government will bring stablecoins into the UK payments system</strong> and “enable consumers to use stablecoin payment services with confidence.” </p>\n<p>The third answer comes from the US where <strong>equity markets are soaring these days</strong> – Nasdaq is up 1.7% and S&P 500 gained 1.2%. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are largely correlated with the US tech stocks, and their price dynamic strongly affects the crypto market. It is supposed that equities grow as the US Federal Reserve strives to tackle inflation without bringing the economy into a new recession. </p>\n<h2 id=\"use-handy-solutions-to-take-profit-from-volatility\">Use Handy Solutions to Take Profit from Volatility</h2>\n<p>While it may be early to judge if the new bull run is upon us, the market has reacted: ChangeNOW is experiencing a surge in exchange activity as you read this. Users made almost 15% more cryptocurrency swaps compared to the previous days. </p>\n<p>This number confirms: crypto enthusiasts are quickly seizing the opportunity to profit that the market offers. They understand that in a volatile environment, fast decisions are king: when the crypto is pumping, every minute is important if you don’t want to lose the potential gains. If we do see that cryptocurrencies grow over the next weeks, now may be the perfect time to enter the market – as the accumulation phase unfolds. <em>Please, don’t take this as financial advice and do your own research prior to any trade.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-protect-my-funds-in-a-bull-run\">How Do I Protect My Funds In a Bull Run?</h2>\n<p>But when the market activity soars, all risks grow – including those related to security of funds. Hackers become more active and hunt for poorly secured wallets. Centralized exchanges are well-protected, but still not truly secure – they store your private data that may be leaked, and also they have the technical means to freeze your account if they find it necessary. </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a>, we took care of all these threats. You don’t have to worry about the security of your funds – your private keys are stored locally on your device and protected by several layers of encryption. You are the owner of your coins. Once the uptrend reaches its highest point, you can easily exchange or sell crypto right within NOW Wallet or via <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW </a>instant swap platform. </p>\n<p>Stay safe, and we wish you good gains in today’s rally! </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":6,"name":"News","description":"Latest cryptocurrency news.

To forge a block, they have to win a competition by finding the block hash faster than other miners. In Proof of Work, you win if you compute fast – which requires running powerful equipment. But there’s only one winner in the competition, and the energy that other miners consume is “wasted”. Many of them use fossil fuels because they are cheap. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-environmental-impact-of-bitcoin-exactly\">What is the environmental impact of Bitcoin, exactly?</h3>\n<p>Here’s some data: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin consumes more electricity than Norway or Sweden and roughly the same amount as Greece. </li>\n<li>According to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index by Digiconomist, the first cryptocurrency generates 37 million of CO2 per year. </li>\n<li>One Bitcoin transaction produces 300 kilograms of CO2. The same amount is generated while burning 130 liters of gasoline or during a 1,600-kilometer car drive. This equals the emission from 750,000 Visa transactions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ethereum stats are a little better but still frightening: the network generates 12 million tons of CO2 each year and 27 kilograms per transaction (like burning 12 liters of gas does). Fortunately, Ethereum is changing its consensus algorithm to the Proof of Stake, and these numbers will soon become hundreds of times smaller. </p>\n<p>This data has sparked fierce debate, and a call to limit or ban mining has emerged. In November 2021, Sweden’s top regulators <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/11/12/europe-must-ban-bitcoin-mining-to-hit-the-1-5c-paris-climate-goal-say-swedish-regulators\">said</a> the country wouldn’t fulfill its obligations under the Paris Agreement unless mining is prohibited. In their open letter, regulators called for a EU-wide ban of mining. </p>\n<h3 id=\"why-is-cutting-bitcoins-со2-emissions-so-hard\">Why is cutting Bitcoin’s СО2 emissions so hard?</h3>\n<p>If the ban goes live and miners leave Sweden, they will continue operations somewhere else, while the goal of the Paris Agreement is to reduce CO2 production worldwide. Data shows that after miners fled China, mining became dirtier: according to the Revisiting Bitcoin&#39;s Carbon Footprint <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/02/26/bitcoin-mining-was-actually-worse-for-the-environment-since-china-banned-it-a-new-study-sa\">study</a>, the share of renewables decreased from 41.6% in 2020 to 25.1% in August 2021. Miners could seasonally use Sichuan and Yunnan hydropower plants in China, but now they leverage natural gas in the USA and the most carbon-intensive type of coal in Kazakhstan.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there’s a different study (Bitcoin Mining Council Report) that demonstrates: 57% of energy used in mining came from renewable sources in Q3 2021. However, research included carbon generation with carbon offsets, so methodological nuances are important when it comes to assessing Bitcoin’s impact. </p>\n<h3 id=\"why-cant-bitcoin-miners-simply-switch-to-renewable-sources\">Why can’t Bitcoin miners simply switch to renewable sources?</h3>\n<p>Green energy is simply more expensive than fossil fuels on average. Mining is a business, after all – and it aims to minimize expenses where possible. Governments could reduce the cost of renewables by law, but that would require high subsidy expenditures. </p>\n<h3 id=\"could-bitcoin-go-pos-to-reduce-emissions\">Could Bitcoin go PoS to reduce emissions?</h3>\n<p>Some eco activists claim that Bitcoin could simply switch to Proof of Stake – and that would solve the problem since the cryptocurrency would consume 99.99% less energy. In response to this, industry players say that this proposal is the result of a lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works. </p>\n<p><em>“Bitcoin will never switch to a PoS consensus algorithm,”</em> – says Max Kordek, CEO & Co-Founder of Lisk, in a comment to ChangeNOW. <em>“Further, I believe Bitcoin should not switch to a PoS consensus algorithm. The world requires 100% censorship resistant and neutral money. Bitcoin is solving that and can become the global settlement layer. However, only with PoW.”</em></p>\n<p>Moreover, Kordek believes that power grids can benefit from Bitcoin’s energy consumption. <em>“Bitcoin miners can improve the stability of electricity grids by turning on mining when the demand for electricity is low and turning it off when the demand for electricity is high. Bitcoin miners can monetize the moments when the demand for electricity is low which allows the electricity grids to operate at near-max capacity at all times.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"flaws-of-the-bitcoins-eco-debate\">Flaws of the Bitcoin’s eco debate</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin’s environmental impact is mostly criticized in developed countries where people have access to financial services, stable economies, and national currencies with relatively low inflation. In the meantime, in developing countries (where 80% of the world’s population lives), Bitcoin brings great value – it provides financial freedom and protects money from hyperinflation. The first cryptocurrency helps the unbanked even in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/crypto-atms-in-2022-explained-why-use-them-in-the-digital-age\">developed countries</a>. </p>\n<p>Bitcoin’s impact debate may even seem hypocritical if we compare its harm with damage from other energy-consuming things. For instance, the first cryptocurrency consumes 1.5 times less energy than household tumble dryers in the USA alone (62 TWh a year against 108 TWh). The dryers are socially accepted, their useful feature is obvious to everyone (unlike Bitcoin’s, apparently), and no one urges to reduce dryers’ CO2 emission. </p>\n<p>Max Kordek believes that cryptocurrency can improve its public perception by offering green solutions and taking care of the environment. <em>“That will increase public acceptance and therefore make crypto more popular and widespread. Therefore, I see it as a vital part in achieving mainstream adoption,”</em> – says the CEO of Lisk. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_06_T173639_203_0f789335fd.png\" alt=\"bitcoin mining energy consumption\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/crypto-energy-consumption\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Here’s another case: in April 2022, the State of New York established a moratorium on mining that uses fossil fuel energy. Vitalik Buterin, known for his criticism of Bitcoin’s impact, roasted this decision. <em>“The government picking and choosing which specific applications are an okay use of electricity or not is a bad idea,”</em> said the co-founder of Ethereum. He was supported by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1532694159022333953\">Nic Carter</a>, a crypto investor and entrepreneur: <em>“Will red states respond and ban computation taking place in their borders used for pornography, Netflix, and Disney?”</em>, said Carter. </p>\n<h3 id=\"calls-for-change\">Calls for change</h3>\n<p><em>“The environmental impact of crypto is an extremely important topic for the industry,”</em> – says Max Kordek. The CEO of Lisk.explains that Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake <em>“shows that this matter is treated very seriously.”</em></p>\n<p>There have been some collaborative initiatives in the crypto community to mitigate environmental damage. One of them, the Crypto Climate Accord, was signed in 2021 by 200+ companies and individuals to reach net-zero operations by 2030, which implies switching to renewable sources of energy.</p>\n<p>The Accord was just a voluntary agreement with no mechanism of enforcement, though. &quot;It clearly is not working because the network actually got less green during the year,” said Alex de Vries, one of the authors of the Revisiting Bitcoin&#39;s Carbon Footprint study. “They need to have some kind of enforcement mechanism, then there may be some kind of reward,” the expert noted. </p>\n<p>However, many large crypto platforms are eco-conscious without any enforcement. Let’s see what cryptocurrencies do for the environment and how major blockchains become climate-neutral.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-climate-neutral-cryptocurrencies\">5 Climate-Neutral Cryptocurrencies</h2>\n<p>Environmental discourse is usually about cutting greenhouse emissions, but this is no longer enough – we’ve gone too far in polluting the atmosphere. It is more productive to think of climate neutrality – an approach where you don’t only reduce CO2 production but also compensate for any remaining emissions (which makes you carbon-neutral) or even go beyond (carbon-negative). The latter implies removing gas from the atmosphere or supporting climate-oriented projects. </p>\n<p>The recent Joe Biden’s executive order on cryptocurrency encourages “exploratory efforts to investigate the environmental benefits of distributed technologies.” The document is one step forward to focusing on projects that improve the climate, not only reduce carbon emissions. However, climate-neutral cryptocurrencies are already all around us, and here are some of the most notable ones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"powerledger-powr--p2p-solar-energy-trading\">Powerledger (POWR) – P2P solar energy trading</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_06_T173651_711_afc5363b02.png\" alt=\"powerledger\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.powerledger.io/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Some households produce energy with solar panels for domestic use. But what if an exceeding amount of electricity has been generated, and the producer wants to share it? This is where Powerledger comes on stage – an energy P2P trading platform. It introduces a system that replaces (or complements) legacy electric grids where energy passes only one-way – from power plants to users. </p>\n<p>Powerledger allows people to track and trade energy in real-time. It creates a more sustainable grid where excess energy generated by solar panels and wind is not wasted but brings income to producers. The project has been operating since 2016 – first, it was based on the Ethereum network, but then migrated to the Powerledger Energy Blockchain on the carbon-neutral Solana network. POWR market capitalization is $109 million as of August 22, and the coin ranks 187th on CoinMarketCap. </p>\n<h3 id=\"algorand--a-green-treasury-for-reforestation\">Algorand – a green treasury for reforestation</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_06_T173703_135_7ec211b430.png\" alt=\"algorand\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.algorand.com/about/media-kit\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Algorand is a layer-1 network for decentralized applications.

The money goes to a “green treasury” maintained in partnership with ClimateTrade – a company that helps organizations compensate for their environmental impact in a cost-efficient way. This way Algorand <a href=\"https://climatetrade.com/algorand-partners-with-climatetrade-to-be-the-greenest-blockchain-with-a-carbon-negative-network/\">funds</a> reforestation in Colombia, protects forests in Cambodia, and produces wind energy in Mexico.

It has implemented the PoS for greater throughput and scalability, introduced human-readable addresses, and ensured sustainable operation of the blockchain. NEAR consciously measures its carbon footprint and reduces it through green initiatives, which makes the platform carbon-neutral. </p>\n<p>In 2021, NEAR partnered with a climate solutions provider South Pole. This step helps decrease the blockchain’s environmental impact to a minimum and offset the remaining CO2 emissions. Currently, NEAR generates 174 tons of CO2 per year – 200,000 times less than Bitcoin does. And this is the key advantage of Proof of Stake – as the NEAR network’s transaction count grows, the blockchain’s carbon footprint increases insignificantly. </p>\n<p>NEAR supports reforestation projects, which makes its blockchain climate-neutral. By sending transactions in the NEAR network, you help <a href=\"https://market.southpole.com/home/offset-emissions\">plant trees</a> in Colombia, Zimbabwe, and the USA. </p>\n<h3 id=\"solana--making-your-fridge-green\">Solana – making your fridge green</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_06_T173725_857_c2d9d3a3f8.png\" alt=\"solana\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gritnova.com/blockchain-crypto-management/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>In December 2021, Solana announced becoming carbon-neutral thanks to its carbon offsets. But it wasn’t due to reforestation or wind energy – Solana Foundation supports refrigerant destruction, one of the most efficient ways to compensate for carbon emissions. This method targets fridges and air conditioners: it eliminates hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that they use, substances that trap heat in the atmosphere 1–9 thousand (!) times more effectively than CO2. </p>\n<p>Even without taking carbon offsets into account, Solana is one of the greenest blockchains out there. Research <a href=\"https://solana.com/news/solana-foundation-carbon-neutral-2021\">showed</a> that it uses less energy than needed for two Google searches. This is 1,939 joules – 400,000 times less than one Ethereum transaction consumes (770,600,000 J) and 3,800,000 times less than one Bitcoin’s (7,412,400,000 J).</p>\n<h3 id=\"filecoin-green\">Filecoin Green</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_06_T173740_348_c95c00176d.png\" alt=\"filecoin\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.filecoin.io/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Filecoin is a decentralized P2P storage system – providers contribute their free disk space where users can store their data in a secure way. Filecoin Green is an initiative that strives to measure the environmental impacts of Filecoin and drive them below zero: it allows storage providers to publicly share their source of electricity and show that it comes from renewable sources and was generated in their area. Besides energy attribute certificates, Filecoin Green is building a Web3-native global marketplace for renewable energy and mobilizes capital to generate more solar power in the USA. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-green-is-the-future-of-crypto\">How Green Is the Future of Crypto?</h2>\n<p>All major layer-1 networks that are gaining traction today have been built on the eco-friendly Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. The only exception to this is Ethereum, but the platform is to abandon Proof of Work by the end of 2022. There is a great abundance of other types of coins, but it’s hard to imagine anyone creating and rapidly developing an energy-consuming PoW crypto in 2022.</p>\n<p>Consequently, today’s main objective is to make the existing mineable cryptocurrencies greener. There is perhaps only one way to ensure this – to make it more profitable for miners to use renewable sources of energy, that is, make renewables cheaper. And if humanity succeeds in this, many businesses and individuals will choose green electricity, not only miners. Everyone will benefit from it – so making low-carbon energy cheaper sounds like an ultimate goal for sustainable development.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":4,"name":"Industry","description":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more. \n\n","slug":"industry","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Industry - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more.

Second, the Merge will lay the ground for further scaling updates, unleashing Ethereum&#39;s full potential as a backbone of the decentralized internet of the future. </p>\n<p>In this article, we explain the Merge and the context behind it, outline the post-merge updates, and guide you into using the PoS Ethereum. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/09_08_ETH_merge_news_explained_01_772b2d9317.png\" alt=\"The Merge Explained: One Step Closer to Scalable Ethereum\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-merge-in-a-nutshell\">The Merge In a Nutshell</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is changing its consensus algorithm – the way transactions are validated on the blockchain. Since its launch, Ethereum has been running on the battle-tested Proof of Work consensus, just like Bitcoin. </p>\n<p>Miners had to solve an array of math problems faster than their competitors in order to validate blocks and receive their reward. To win this competition, they leveraged powerful equipment that consumed tremendous amounts of energy. </p>\n<p>Such a model proved too cumbersome and inefficient for Ethereum’s thriving economy. Due to low throughput, the network frequently got congested, resulting in fees of $50-80 per single transaction. Poor scalability threatened to make Ethereum uncompetitive compared to newer public blockchains.</p>\n<p>In 2020, <strong>Beacon Chain</strong> was launched – an Ethereum network running on the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. This mechanism eliminates the energy-consuming hardware competition, and it gives the right to validate blocks to those who have a stake (locked funds) in the Ethereum network. </p>\n<p>This September, the current Ethereum mainnet will merge with the Beacon Chain, and the entire network will start running on Proof of Stake. This will remove mining and set the stage for further scaling updates – those that will increase Ethereum throughput and reduce gas fees over the next 1-2 years. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/IMG_7695_5615fc9ed9.PNG\" alt=\"ethereum merge\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Now, let’s break this down. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ethereum-vision--why-does-eth-abandon-proof-of-stake\">The Ethereum Vision – Why Does ETH Abandon Proof of Stake?</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/vision/\">Ethereum Vision</a>, there are three main challenges that the network addresses by introducing Proof of Stake: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clogged network.</strong> Ethereum is home to a huge portion of DeFi, GameFi, NFT, and metaverse industries. The network capacity is too poor to cover such a high demand, so Ethereum needs to improve its speed for a global user base.</li>\n<li><strong>Too much disk space.</strong> As the network grows, the Ethereum blockchain size is rapidly increasing, and it becomes too hard to store it on a single device to run a node. To ensure decentralization, Ethereum needs to lower the hardware requirements for node operators. </li>\n<li><strong>Too much energy.</strong> With Proof of Work, Ethereum produces over 12 million tons of CO2 per year. The network needs to become more sustainable. Once the Ethereum mainnet implements the <em>transition</em> to PoS, one node won’t consume more energy than a regular PC. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>An easy but ‘naive’ solution, according to the Ethereum vision, would be to scale the network in a centralized manner. However, it is decentralization that ensures censorship resistance, openness, data privacy, and nearly unbreakable security – things Ethereum is loved for. </p>\n<p>According to the blockchain trilemma, there are three key parameters of a network – security, scalability, and decentralization, but only two of the three can be improved at a time. The Merge and the subsequent sharding are meant to challenge this statement. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-merge--what-is-it-exactly\">The Merge – What Is It, Exactly?</h2>\n<p>In December 2020, Ethereum’s devs launched Beacon Chain – a Proof of Stake blockchain running separately <em>from</em> the Ethereum mainnet. A staking smart contract was deployed in this blockchain, allowing users to freeze their coins and receive rewards for validating blocks. As of September 13, 2022, <a href=\"https://beaconcha.in\">there are</a> 425K+ validators who stake over $13.6M worth of Ether in the Beacon Chain. </p>\n<p>During the Merge, the current Ethereum mainnet, dubbed as Eth1, won’t simply change its consensus algorithm to PoS. It will continue to be part of the Ethereum blockchain as an <strong>‘execution layer’</strong>, where all transactions and smart contracts will operate. Beacon Chain, or Eth2, will become the** ‘consensus layer’**, responsible for validating blocks. Thus, Eth1 and Eth2 will <strong>merge</strong> into one single Ethereum, and <em>Proof of Work</em> will be abandoned.</p>\n<p>Safe Merge has been ensured by extensive testing, bug bounties, and several merges of Ethereum testnets.</p>\n<p>In Proof of Stake Ethereum, the ‘weight’ of a validator’s vote will depend on how much Ether they are staking. The size of the stake also defines the validator’s reward. Besides reduced energy consumption and hardware requirements, Proof of Stake makes Ethereum even more secure. The network will become more resistant to attacks, since it’s close to impossible to accumulate enough resources to have a big-enough stake to control the blockchain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scaling-ethereum-after-the-merge\">Scaling Ethereum After the Merge</h2>\n<p>The next big event after the Merge is the Shanghai upgrade, scheduled to take place 6-12 months later. It will enable unstaking (we’ll get back to this later), improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and reduce gas fees for Layer 2 transactions. </p>\n<p>Together with the Merge, Shanghai will lay the ground for <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/\">sharding</a> – the next major update that will increase scalability and throughput of the network. These post-merge events will implement Ethereum’s <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/vision/\">vision</a> of becoming “powerful enough to help all of humanity.” </p>\n<h3 id=\"sharding-will-make-nodes-lightweight-and-accessible\">Sharding will make nodes lightweight and accessible</h3>\n<p>As mentioned before, Ethereum blockchain size is increasing, and nodes struggle to keep it in a single place. Sharding splits the transaction database, so the node can operate with just a fraction of it. It will become possible <em>to</em> run Ethereum from a PC or even mobile phone. </p>\n<h3 id=\"decentralization-and-room-for-growth\">Decentralization and room for growth</h3>\n<p>As nodes become more accessible, more people will run them. More validators, in turn, ensure better decentralization and higher security. A splitted database will also keep providing good throughput even while transaction load and the blockchain size are growing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharding-and-rollups\">Sharding and Rollups</h3>\n<p>Sharding will operate together with rollups – a technology that bundles (or rolls up) hundreds of Layer-2 transactions (like on Polygon or Arbitrum) into one on Ethereum mainnet. Gas fees for one Ethereum transaction are split between a hundred on L2. Moreover, sharding breaks large amounts of data needed by rollups into little pieces, thus reducing the burden. </p>\n<p>PoS-based Beacon Chain as a consensus layer of Ethereum will coordinate validators between shards – that’s why the Merge is necessary to scale the network. </p>\n<p>Sharding is to be implemented during 2023 and 2024. </p>\n<h2 id=\"do-i-have-to-prepare-for-the-merge-as-a-user\">Do I Have to Prepare for the Merge as a User?</h2>\n<p>Whether you keep ETH coins in your wallet, own LP or any other ERC20 tokens, <strong>you don’t have to do anything before or after the Merge</strong>. In terms of user experience, the Merge will go unnoticed, and you will keep access to your assets just the way you did it before the update. </p>\n<h2 id=\"will-the-merge-reduce-gas-fees\">Will the Merge Reduce Gas Fees?</h2>\n<p>There are several popular <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/\">misconceptions</a> about the Merge, and one of them says that the update will immediately cut gas fees. However, there will be no such effect right away. The Merge lays the ground for sharding and other future updates that will scale Ethereum and reduce gas fees, but these effects won’t take place directly from switching to <em>Proof of Stake</em>.</p>\n<p>Gas fees are determined by supply (network capacity) and demand (transactions count). Currently, when trading activity rises, the supply can’t cover the demand, the network congests, and fees skyrocket. Ethereum’s scaling will help increase supply to freely fulfill huge demand and keep fees low, but that will come with further scaling updates after the Merge.    </p>\n<h2 id=\"will-the-merge-speed-up-ethereum-transactions\">Will the Merge Speed Up Ethereum Transactions?</h2>\n<p>The switch to Proof of Stake does not increase block size or dramatically reduce block time – the speed won’t change significantly after the Merge. The block time <em>is</em> supposed to decrease from 13.3 to 12 seconds, so only a 10% acceleration should be expected. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-stake-ethereum\">How Can I Stake Ethereum?</h2>\n<p>Instead of mining Ethereum, you will be able to stake it on mainnet following the Merge. There will be no need for expensive hardware anymore, but there are still certain requirements. </p>\n<p><strong>Solo staking</strong> (current APR <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/\">about 4.1%</a>)  comes with the largest cost: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The minimum size of stake is 32 ETH. </li>\n<li>There are responsibilities of running a validator. You have to run an Ethereum node and maintain its proper operation 24/7. </li>\n<li>Staked funds are immovable. Once you start staking, you won&#39;t be able to unstake your coins before the Shanghai upgrade that is to take place 6-12 months after the Merge. However, staking rewards are liquid and will start accumulating in your wallet right away. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pool staking</strong> allows you to invest much less than 32 ETH – but there’s still no unstaking, and the pool will charge a fee. </p>\n<p>You can also <strong>stake on a crypto exchange</strong>. Any amount of ETH can be staked, but again, you can’t unlock the coins before Shanghai, and the exchange may charge high fees. This goes with traditional risks of centralized crypto exchanges who maintain full control over your coins. </p>\n<h3 id=\"liquid-staking\">Liquid staking</h3>\n<p><strong>Liquid staking</strong> is a decent alternative where you don’t have to completely freeze your coins. Here’s how it works: you stake Ether in a third-party protocol, it issues you a tokenized version of the staked funds, and you can store, invest, or trade them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lido.fi/\">Lido</a> is one of the most popular liquid staking protocols. When you stake your ETH there, it sends you <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/steth\">stETH</a> tokens in return, which you can use for lending, collateral, and more. Your daily staking rewards will accumulate in your Ethereum wallet, so you can access your earnings anytime. ETH can be redeemed back for stETH at any moment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"will-ethereum-hard-fork-and-what-is-ethpow\">Will Ethereum Hard Fork, and What is ETHPoW?</h2>\n<p>At the end of June, an influential miner Chandler Guo expressed an idea to create an Ethereum hard fork, a coin named ETHPoW (ETHW), that would continue to run on the Proof of Work consensus even after the Merge. His supporters, a small but vocal group of Ethereum critics, said that the hard fork is “inevitable” as it sees huge demand in the community. </p>\n<p>The idea, however, was met with criticism. The head of ETC Cooperative Bob Summerwill wrote in an open letter to Guo that the miners simply don’t have time to deal with all tech issues to run the fork. But even if ETHPoW goes live, its benefits for users are highly questionable – the largest stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi protocols won’t be interested in deploying on an obsolete chain, said Summerwill. The experts of CoinShares, a digital asset management firm, called the potential PoW hard fork “unviable.”</p>\n<p>In turn, ETHW supporters claimed to have created a dedicated dev team that had already prepared for the fork; there are ETHPoW futures in the market that are now <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-pow/\">trading</a> at $29.</p>\n<p>While no one knows whether ETHW will ever exist, ChangeNOW <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/changenow-statement-on-the-upcoming-ethereum-merge\">has prepared</a> for the Merge and the potential fork. The entire <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW</a> ecosystem including <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://nowpayments.io/\">NOWPayments</a>, and <a href=\"https://nownodes.io/\">NOWNodes</a> will operate in normal mode when Ethereum goes PoS, and ETHW will be listed if its mainnet goes live. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-will-the-merge-affect-the-market\">How Will the Merge Affect the Market?</h2>\n<p>On August 26, the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed: the Fed will keep increasing interest rates before high inflation is tackled. The crypto market, still not having fully recovered after the summer liquidity crisis, reacted with another price drop.  </p>\n<p>The Merge, however, is something that can help <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2022/09/02/the-fed-policy-and-the-merge-cryptos-two-biggest-moments/\">revive the market</a>. “First of all, the argument that Ethereum, DeFi, and NFTs are harmful to the environment will be put to rest. Consequently, ESG-compliant institutions will find Ether an appealing investment,” – says Mike Ermolaev, head of PR at ChangeNOW. The issuance of ETH coins is supposed to decrease, which will eventually help push the Ethereum price up. It is unlikely that the Merge will immediately end the crypto winter, but it does give hope to breathe new life into the cryptocurrency market.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":4,"name":"Industry","description":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more. \n\n","slug":"industry","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Industry - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more.
