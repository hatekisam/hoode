Even as a newbie in the blockchain space, chances are you’ve heard about the Solana ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The network touts itself as the most performant permissionless blockchain globally, but with the crypto industry’s growth, it can be hard to keep up with all the new developments. Let’s explore Solana’s ins and outs and its evolution from its inception in 2017 up to 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-solana\">What is Solana?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-solana-blockchain\">Introducing the Solana Blockchain</h3>\n<p><strong>Solana</strong> is a blockchain platform that is designed to host decentralized and scalable applications. It is an open-source network, which means that developers can build and launch their own decentralized applications using it. Solana initially emerged as a rival to the Ethereum (<a href=\"link\">ETH</a>) blockchain. Like the latter, it offers smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s other core features include its high speed, with the potential to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, and low transaction costs averaging at $0.00025. Transaction fees on Solana are in the network’s native token, <a href=\"link\">SOL</a>.</p>\n<p>The Solana coin is a utility token that functions as a medium of exchange and helps prop up security on the platform via staking. The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former executive at Qualcomm, in 2017 and is currently run by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-solana\">A brief history of Solana</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-and-why-solana-was-created\">How and why Solana was created</h3>\n<p>Solana emerged in response to the scalability limitations of existing blockchain platforms such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BTC</a>) and Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Bitcoin price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believed that agreement on time was one of the biggest challenges of a distributed model.</p>\n<p>Yakovenko recognized that a reliable and accurate clock was crucial for network synchronization. As such, he began working on and developed the concept of <a href=\"link\">proof of history</a>. This technique allows for keeping time between untrusted computers, making network synchronization simpler and faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-exactly-is-solanas-proof-of-history\">What exactly is Solana’s proof of history?</h3>\n<p>The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism is Solana’s chosen technique to keep the time between computers that do not trust each other. The basic idea behind PoH is to use a &quot;timestamp&quot; that is generated by a central server and broadcast to all nodes on the network. This timestamp serves as a reference point for the network, allowing all nodes to agree on the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_26_18_PM_b5d4d80061.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.26.18 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"link\">Medium</a> </p>\n<p>To generate the timestamp, the central server creates a &quot;hash&quot; of a large amount of data (known as a &quot;PoH generator&quot;) and publishes it to the network. Each node on the network can then use this hash to verify the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p>The PoH generator is designed to be computationally expensive to create, ensuring it can only be generated by a central server and not by any individual node on the network. This helps to prevent any one node from manipulating the timestamp or the sequence of events.</p>\n<p>By using the PoH mechanism, Solana can achieve high levels of network synchronization and scalability, allowing it to process a large number of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement over other blockchain systems that lack a reliable clock and struggle to scale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-journey-to-the-solana-launch-yakovenkos-path\">The journey to the Solana launch: Yakovenko’s path</h3>\n<p>Solana was technically created in November 2017 when Anatoly Yakovenko published the whitepaper for the proof-of-history concept. This technique would serve as the foundation for the Solana project. With plans to weave all the world&#39;s transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called it Loom.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald <a href=\"link\">published</a> the first open-source implementation of the PoH technique on GitHub under the name Silk. The project quickly gained traction, and the team continued to develop it.</p>\n<p>By March 2018, the team rebranded the project as Solana, a nod to the small beach town where Yakovenko and his team lived and worked. In June of that same year, they had scaled the technology to run on cloud-based networks. The next month, they published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>After months of testing and development, the Solana mainnet went live on March 31, 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-price-evolution\">Solana price evolution</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-is-solana-worth\">How much is Solana worth?</h3>\n<p>Solana’s SOL token, like most cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price fluctuations. In the first few months after the launch, the Solana price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1.00.</p>\n<p>However, in late 2020, the price of Solana began to rise rapidly. Driven by the non-fungible token (NFT) hype and the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. SOL more than tripled to a peak of $18.00 in early 2021. Solana reached its all-time high of $258 in November 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_40_45_PM_ff2553a118.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.40.45 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Solana price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these gains were nearly wiped out by the end of last year due to the crypto crash and subsequent contagion. Solana’s price took a hard hit from FTX’s implosion due to its close association with the exchange and subsidiaries. SOL dropped under $10 in late December for the first time since February 2021. However, it has recovered in the past month to trade at $24.22 currently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-solana-coins-are-there\">How many Solana coins are there?</h3>\n<p>The Solana foundation revealed that the total number of Solana (SOL) coins to enter circulation is 489 million. At the moment, 260 million tokens are available on the market. </p>\n<h3 id=\"where-can-you-buy-solana\">Where can you buy Solana?</h3>\n<p>Solana (SOL) can be purchased on a variety of exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and <a href=\"link\">ChangeNow</a>. With a user-friendly interface and a wide variety of payment options, ChangeNow makes it easy for anyone to purchase SOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanas-major-developments\">Solana’s major developments</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2019\">Solana’s 2019</h3>\n<p>Right before the Solana mainnet launch, much of the team’s attention was on obtaining funding to develop its new crypto network. The project had already begun to gain traction.</p>\n<p>As such, the team was able to raise $20 million in a private token sale led by Multicoin Capital in Q1 2019. Other participants were Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2020\">Solana’s 2020</h3>\n<p>The year 2020 marked Solana’s emergence as the first blockchain to use proof of history. The platform launched on Mainnet Beta in March 2020, following successful fundraising and the launch of their public test network, Tour de SOL.</p>\n<p>That same year, <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href=\"link\">USDT</a>) launched Solana-native <strong>USDT</strong> and Circle partnered to make <strong><a href=\"link\">USDC</a></strong> a native stablecoin on the platform. Solana also held its first hackathon from October 28 to November 14.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Tether price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2021\">Solana’s 2021</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s 2020 hackathon and subsequent ones were a success, leading to an influx of developers and projects onto the platform. By December 2021, Solana had exceeded 1,000 projects and saw a significant rise in its price and daily active users. This propelled the SOL token to the fifth spot on the crypto list, surpassing <strong>Cardano</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<p>However, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for 17 hours. The platform had formerly gone down for 6 hours in December 2021, earning it a reputation for frequent outages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Cardano price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2022\">Solana’s 2022</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s outage problem persisted into 2022. Despite this, the network was able to make some progress. Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, announced integration with Ethereum and Polygon. In June, Solana revealed plans for the first crypto smartphone, the Solana Saga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/solana_saga_01_7aaaabbbc6.jpg\" alt=\"solana-saga_01.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>The platform also opened a physical store in New York City dedicated to all things crypto in July. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Solana_just_launched_a_physical_store_in_metaverse_79dcec4278.jpg\" alt=\"Solana-just-launched-a-physical-store-in-metaverse.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>Notably, Solana&#39;s NFT market experienced substantial growth in 2022, with the number of minted NFTs reaching 312,000 on September 7. Additionally, Solana NFT trading volumes rose to hit $11.5 million on September 6.</p>\n<p>However, in August, the platform&#39;s mobile wallet suffered a hack resulting in $8 million worth of losses. Thousands of Solana users suffered in the attack, which Solana ultimately blamed on a third-party platform, the Slope mobile wallet app. Solana experienced more losses later on as the FTX and Alameda saga caused the single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics as SOL dipped 96%. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solana-ecosystem\">The Solana ecosystem</h3>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem is home to a diverse range of projects, from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The platform’s speed, affordability, and scalability mean it is quickly becoming a go-to destination for developers, entrepreneurs, and users who want to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications and services. </p>\n<p>Among these projects are <strong>Phantom</strong>, a decentralized social network that empowers users to share content, earn rewards, and connect with others; <strong>Stepn</strong> (<a href=\"link\">GMT</a>), a platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows artists and creators to monetize their work. Solana also hosts <strong>Star Atlas</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ATLAS</a>), a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading digital assets, and <strong>Audius</strong>, initially built on Ethereum but moved to Solana in 2020, a decentralized streaming platform for musicians that enables them to control their music and earn royalties directly from fans.</p>\n<p>More recently, <strong>BONK</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BONK</a>),  “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people,” which was released in December 2020. </p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Like most other projects in the crypto industry, Solana reaped the benefits of 2021’s DeFi and NFT boom. In the same vein, it was unable to escape the impact of the crypto winter in 2022. Still, its attractive blend of speed and affordability, thanks to its unique technology, makes it a staple for most developers in this space. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest SOL trading pairs <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Also Read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/analyst-predicts-sols-price-prior-to-solanas-milestone-conference\">Analyst Predicts SOL’s Price Prior to Solana’s Conference</a></li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-26T19:28:00.275Z","createdAt":"2023-01-26T18:47:45.949Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-02T10:18:16.163Z"},{"id":1366,"title":"ChangeNOW stands against fraudulent actions amid Alameda wallets' suspicious activity","description":"Taking into account the company's high AML standards in terms of resistance to illegal activity, ChangeNOW is putting serious effort into preventing such incidents as the recent Alameda wallets’ case.","slug":"changenow-stands-against-fraudulent-actions-ensures-high-compliance-standards-amid-alameda-wallets-suspicious-activity","metaTitle":"ChangeNOW position amid Alameda suspicious activity","metaDescription":"The compliance team works round-the-clock with investigation inquiries related to Alameda funds movement","featuredImage":{"id":6782,"name":"12.28 Alameda Incident Statement-01.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Once fraudulent activity was first reported by investigators, the ChangeNOW compliance team responded immediately and blocklisted suspicious wallets.

But confidential transactions aren’t enough. Such a project needs to remain usable and scalable to receive enough support and adoption from the community.</p>\n<p>Is BEAM coin a good investment, and has their development team managed to find the perfect balance between privacy and utility? </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_07_BEAM_review_01_cd9771af1c.png\" alt=\"Beam Coin Review 2022\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-beam-coin\">What Is Beam Coin?</h2>\n<p>Beam is an open-source privacy-focused cryptocurrency based on the <strong>Mimblewimble</strong> <strong>protocol</strong>. It’s not a fork or a clone of an existing digital asset; its codebase is unique and built solely in-house. Beam is far from being the first project that guarantees anonymity. Still, it aims to correct some of the mistakes of its predecessors, such as Monero or ZCash. </p>\n<p>Beam was launched in 2018, and its mainnet went live in January 2019. In contrast to many other altcoins, there was no ICO, no crowd sales, and no pre-mined coins. Similarly to Bitcoin, this digital currency is deflationary and undergoes a halving once every 4 years. Beam has a maximum supply of over 262 million units, and around 47% of all coins are already in circulation. </p>\n<p>The coin’s blockchain doesn’t display public transaction data, allowing users to remain completely private by default. Confidentiality is a desirable feature for individuals and businesses alike. After all, you wouldn’t want everyone to know your income, how you spend your money, and where.</p>\n<p>Beam manages all that, and yet remains decentralized, scalable, and optionally auditable. By removing transaction data from the chain, the project doesn’t suffer from blockchain bloat like some other cryptocurrencies.     </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-beam-team\">The Beam Team</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/beam-coin/#The_BEAM_Team\">developers and creators</a> of Beam are seasoned professionals in technology and entrepreneurship. </p>\n<p>The CEO of the project is a software developer, executive, and crypto advisor <strong>Alexander Zaidelson</strong>. Beam’s CTO is <strong>Alex Romanov</strong>, an experienced Research and Development manager. <strong>Amir Aaronson</strong> is an entrepreneur and the team’s Chief Operating Officer. Lastly, it’s vital to mention <strong>Beni Issembert</strong>. He is a lecturer, writer, and entrepreneur who worked as Beam’s CMO and is a member of the Board of Advisors. </p>\n<p>A non-profit company called <strong><a href=\"https://www.beam-foundation.org/\">Beam Foundation</a></strong> is responsible for promoting, maintaining, and developing this coin’s ecosystem. Their goal is to achieve maximum decentralization and provide the community with complete control over governance. </p>\n<p>The Beam Foundation has a Board of Directors with 4 team members: <strong>Guy</strong> <strong>Corem</strong>, <strong>Bo</strong> <strong>Dong</strong>, <strong>Wilke</strong> <strong>Trei</strong>, and <strong>Ferdous</strong> <strong>Bhai</strong>.      </p>\n<h2 id=\"beam-roadmap\">Beam Roadmap</h2>\n<p>The Beam development team has been hard at work since 2019, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/beam-mw/beam-roadmap-update-q3-2021-8c572598df44\">a lot has already been achieved</a>. </p>\n<p>The most notable events of 2019 were the release of Android and iOS wallets and a cold wallet. Atomic Swaps between BEAM, BTC, LTC, and QTUM were introduced in the same year. 2020 will be remembered for creating a mobile node and introducing Confidential Assets on the mainnet. </p>\n<p>In 2022, users gained access to an in-wallet dApp store, and the Beam Virtual Machine was coded. But that’s not all. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) has been integrated with the BEAM blockchain, and an Asset Swap Marketplace has gone live. The most recent roadmap reveals that crypto bridges are now functioning with Ethereum and BSC. </p>\n<p>Three additional items are highlighted for 2022:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oracles</li>\n<li>EVM Support</li>\n<li>Sidechains</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-beam-network\">The Beam Network</h2>\n<p>Beam is a <strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong> type of coin that works with a <strong>BeamHash III</strong> consensus algorithm. It was originally intended to be used as a store of value and not a day-to-day means of exchange and payments. </p>\n<p>The blockchain’s <strong>transaction per second count</strong> is around <strong>17</strong> and is much higher than that of Bitcoin or privacy coin Monero. But thanks to Beam’s usage of the Mimblewimble protocol, the blockchain is significantly smaller. It contains much less data than many other cryptocurrency networks. </p>\n<p>The technology behind the coin has noteworthy <a href=\"https://documentation.beam.mw/\">features and use cases</a>.  </p>\n<p>Network transactions are totally private to the outside world. They contain no identifiable data about senders, receivers, or transferred amounts. Naturally, participants in the transaction know who they are dealing with. </p>\n<p>However, Beam transactions can be auditable if the parties want them to. <strong>Opt-in audibility</strong> is available through the wallet, allowing transaction history to be saved and shared with auditors and regulators. </p>\n<p>New tokens called <strong>Confidential Assets</strong> can be created on the Beam network. By looking at blockchain data, the UTXOs of confidential assets aren’t any different from Beam UTXOs. These tokens don’t have their own smart contracts, meaning there is no need to audit and verify new pieces of code.</p>\n<p>The ecosystem features built-in <strong>Atomic Swaps</strong> in the official Beam wallet. Users can exchange their BEAM and network tokens P2P with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Qtum, Dash, and Dogecoin. Other decentralized swap possibilities will be introduced in the future.</p>\n<p>The smart contracts are called <strong>Beam Shaders</strong>. They use the Beam Virtual Machine (BVM) to create and run confidential and decentralized applications on the network. The ecosystem has the means to incorporate other innovations, like DEXs, NFTs, wrapped tokens, sidechains, and bridges. Developers are planning to create their own algorithmic stablecoins and a lending platform, among other things.        </p>\n<p>Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is one of the most notable features in recent years. Beam has created its own payment channel called <strong>Laser Beam</strong>. It enables instant off-chain crypto transactions between two parties with later settlement and on-chain confirmation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_6a1a297b0d.jpeg\" alt=\"beam network\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beam.mw/\">Image source</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-different-types-of-transactions\">The different Types of Transactions</h3>\n<p>It’s essential to note that Beam supports 3 different transaction types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Online transactions</strong> require that both senders and receivers are online within 12 hours of the transaction broadcast. The mining fees for online transactions are the lowest among all transaction types.</li>\n<li><strong>Offline transactions</strong> – these require somewhat higher fees than their online equivalent. When you send an offline transaction, the receiver doesn’t need to come online within 12 hours of it being broadcasted. </li>\n<li><strong>Max Privacy transactions</strong> are a subcategory of offline transactions with advanced anonymity features. They can take up to 72 hours to be considered final. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-beam-coin\">How to Mine Beam Coin</h2>\n<p>Beam is a decentralized PoW type of cryptocurrency that can be <a href=\"https://beam.mw/mining\">mined with GPUs</a>. The mining algorithm used is a modified version of Equihash called <strong>Beam Hash III</strong>. On average, a new block is generated and added to the chain every minute and contains around 1.000 transactions.</p>\n<p>When the Beam blockchain was launched, the block rewards were set at <strong>80 units per block</strong>. The current reward structure is <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/BEAM-Mining\">40 BEAM per block</a></strong> and will be valid in years 2-5 of its existence. In year 6, miners will earn only <strong>25 BEAM/block</strong>. The project will then begin regular halving events every 4 years until the emission goes down to 0, which is expected 130+ years from now.</p>\n<p>BEAM can be mined with both AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards. The following mining software can be utilized in the process:</p>\n<p><strong>AMD</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>lolMiner</li>\n<li>Gminer</li>\n<li>OpenCL</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NVIDIA</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>lolMiner</li>\n<li>Gminer</li>\n<li>miniZ</li>\n<li>Bminer</li>\n<li>OpenCL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those interested in mining can either become <strong>solo miners</strong> or join a <strong>mining pool</strong>. A GPU of at least <strong>3GB</strong> of memory is a requirement. Over 70% of the network’s hashrate comes from mining pools, where two entities control more than 50% of the computational power. Before getting involved in mining, it’s possible to calculate the efficiency and potential reward structure using the calculator on the <a href=\"https://beam.mw/mining\">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>More information about pool mining can be found <a href=\"https://beamx.gitbook.io/beam-mining/pool-mining-beam\">here</a>. Installation instructions and guides to begin solo mining are explained in <a href=\"https://beamx.gitbook.io/beam-mining/solo-mining-beam\">Solo Mining Beam</a>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"beam-coin-price-prediction\">Beam Coin Price Prediction</h2>\n<h3 id=\"cryptopredictionscom\">CryptoPredictions.com</h3>\n<p>The market experts from <strong><a href=\"https://cryptopredictions.com/beam/\">CryptoPredictions.com</a></strong> have analyzed BEAM, and here is what they say about the project.  </p>\n<p>BEAM is currently trading at around $0.16/coin, and they predict a rise in the value in the remaining months of 2022. This asset could be trading between $0.23 and $0.29. The first 6 months of 2023 are bearish, but the second part of the year looks much better. BEAM is expected to go above $0.30/unit in September 2023 and finish the year at $0.32.</p>\n<p>A bullish sentiment is present throughout 2024, with predicted movements from $0.33 to $0.40 per BEAM. The price predictors anticipate a reversal during most of 2025 before the coin goes on a new run in 2026. The maximum price could be reached in November or December 2026 at over $0.46.</p>\n<h3 id=\"coincodex\">CoinCodex</h3>\n<p>The team from <strong><a href=\"https://coincodex.com/crypto/beam/price-prediction/\">CoinCodex</a></strong> has this to say about Beam.</p>\n<p>They don’t expect significant price movements in the next 50 days and predict a maximum value of $0.18 a coin. The outlook for the 200-day analysis is somewhat better, and BEAM could reach $0.20 in this period. </p>\n<p>Based on similar market trends, the greatest returns on investment should be expected in 2023, 2024, and 2025. If their analysis methods are accurate, BEAM could be trading between $0.25 and $0.44 in 2023. In 2024, this cryptocurrency is predicted to be worth at least $0.48 to a maximum of $0.98. And finally, 2025 is the big year when it’s expected that BEAM goes above $2 a coin. </p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-buy-and-store-beam\">Where To Buy and Store BEAM</h2>\n<h3 id=\"beam-wallets\">Beam Wallets</h3>\n<p>The BEAM cryptocurrency can be safely stored in several <a href=\"https://beam.mw/downloads/mainnet-windows\">official wallets</a> available for different devices and operating systems.   </p>\n<p>The <strong>desktop client</strong> supports Mac, Windows, and Linux. It can be used for sending and receiving BEAM, performing Atomic Swaps, accessing decentralized applications, and working with Confidential Assets. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, those who prefer a command line style can utilize the <strong>CLI Wallet</strong>. This wallet must be used if you are performing lightning payments or running Beam Shaders (smart contracts). </p>\n<p>Lastly, there is <strong>Beam Node</strong>, which is a full-node client. It works in either a mining or validating capacity. When in mining mode, the wallet verifies transactions and adds new blocks to the chain. In validating mode, the app is a data record keeper of the entire blockchain.</p>\n<p><strong>The Beam mobile wallet</strong> is available for iOS and Android phones. It almost supports the entire spectrum of ecosystem features aside from Atomic Swaps and dApps (only available in the desktop client).</p>\n<p>The development team has also released a <strong>Beam Web Wallet</strong>. It’s still in beta but allows customers to send and receive the native currency and Confidential Assets. </p>\n<h3 id=\"beam-crypto-exchanges\">Beam Crypto Exchanges</h3>\n<p>If you want to know where to buy BEAM crypto, head over to <strong><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/beam\">ChangeNOW</a></strong>.

In May 2021, Elon Musk announced that he would pay for the mission with Dogecoin thus putting it “on the literal moon.” </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_18_T195748_186_c451693c22.png\" alt=\"elon musk tweet\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1391523807148527620\">Image source</a> </p>\n<p>One of the best upcoming crypto projects related to space was conceived in partnership with a few companies including Intuitive Machines of Houston and Geometric Energy Corporation. It will put a 40-kilogram satellite into lunar orbit to collect information about the Moon. The machine will be launched with the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. </p>\n<p>DOGE-1 was announced amid the Dogecoin rally initiated by Musk in 2021. In a Saturday Night Live show last year, he invited his mother May Musk on stage and joked (or not?) he’d give her some Dogecoin for Mother’s Day; in the same show, he acted as Lloyd Ostertag, a financial expert, and asked to call him a ‘Dogefather.’ Two days later, DOGE-1 was announced – but something went wrong and the launch was delayed a few times. We hope the announcement wasn’t just a publicity stunt and Doge will become the first crypto in space – the way mission representatives <a href=\"https://finbold.com/dogecoin-mission-to-the-moon-reportedly-still-on-after-delays/\">reassure</a>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"space-race-20-current-and-future-crypto-projects\">Space Race 2.0: Current and Future Crypto Projects</h2>\n<p>Space is a $350 billion market today, and it is expected to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/why-the-space-industry-may-triple-to-1point4-trillion-by-2030.html\">surge</a> to $1.4 trillion in the next 10 years. About 400 private companies are operating in space – and some of them already partner with crypto.  </p>\n<p>Here’s just one example – in September 2021, Winklevoss twins invested $650 million in Payload, a digital media company covering business, policy, and societal aspects of space. This is a quite novel approach – most journals of this kind have been consumer-focused to date, writing mostly about space travel. </p>\n<p>The growing interest in space from private companies has been dubbed the “Space Race 2.0”. One of the industry players who supports this term is Jeff Garzik, an early Bitcoin Core engineer and the CTO of SpaceChain – a cryptocurrency space company building satellite-based blockchain infrastructure. Garzik believes that in 10 years, entrepreneurs will deploy “Antarctica-style bases” on the Moon that will be supplied with payloads from the Earth, in part thanks to upcoming crypto projects. “A three-day journey to the moon will be pretty normal,”  predicts Garzik. </p>\n<p>One of the benefits of developing the Moon is that it will make Mars missions more accessible – much less gravity has to be overcome to launch a rocket from the Moon’s surface. But what does that have to do with blockchain and space crypto companies? </p>\n<h2 id=\"space-race-and-the-wild-west\">Space Race and the Wild West</h2>\n<p>Currently, we’re at the earliest stages of lunar development – but when supply runs to the Moon begin, when “Antarctica-style bases” are built and rovers start streaming videos from the Moon, there will have to be some funding and infrastructure backing this emerging economy. In the 1960’s, space missions were financed by NASA and taxpayers, and today, it is the turn of private companies and crypto space agencies like <a href=\"https://spacechain.com/\">SpaceChain</a>. </p>\n<p>Jeff Garzik, the platform’s CTO, says that the communications infrastructure on the Moon will be equivalent to phone towers linking bases in Antarctica. SpaceChain, the company that is building this infrastructure, can be thought of as a business that was constructing railroads in the Wild West of the 1800’s as the Gold Rush unfolded. Today, these railroads (communication and funding facilities) is what crypto space offers to Moon explorers.  </p>\n<p>All these metaphors proposed by Garzik and his romantic perception of lunar development are rooted in his childhood. “I’m a big sci-fi nerd,” said the engineer who fell in love with space in the 1980’s, when his father took him to watch NASA shuttle launches on Cape Canaveral.</p>\n<p>On a more formal note, SpaceChain leverages trustless and open-source blockchain for communication and commerce in space, making it more accessible to the public. This is achieved using Decentralized Satellite Infrastructure (DSI) for blockchain – network nodes operating on satellites and aboard the International Space Station. SpaceChain allows for building satellite-based applications, smart contracts and assets; its native SPC space crypto coin enables developers to create payment apps, while users can store data and take advantage of dApps. </p>\n<p>Here’s a few examples of SpaceChain use cases available today. </p>\n<h3 id=\"space-protected-multisig-wallet\">Space-protected multisig wallet</h3>\n<p>One of the most critical vulnerabilities of today’s crypto wallets is that if somebody gets access to your private keys, they gain complete control over your coins. SpaceChain has created a wallet with an extra layer of security: there’s one more private key that is stored on a satellite – a device whose laser and radio communication is exceptionally hard to hack. When a user initiates a transaction, it is signed with both Earth- and satellite-based private keys. </p>\n<p>The wallet has been developed with the financial aid from the European Space Agency. The first transaction worth 0.01 BTC was sent in 2020. </p>\n<h3 id=\"space-infrastructure-made-accessible\">Space infrastructure made accessible</h3>\n<p>Today’s orbit- and Moon-based infrastructure is available only to giant companies with huge capital. What’s more, its centralized nature hinders its potential in terms of secure value exchange and censorship resistance. This is where SpaceChain comes on stage – in its decentralized satellite applications (DSA) platform, anyone can create a wallet, place an order, and satellite companies will contact them, provide all necessary space data, and help analyze it. </p>\n<p>Space Chain’s Decentralized Satellite Infrastructure gives life to space-based apps such as crypto exchanges, secure data storage, protected P2P messaging, global real-time sensor arrays, space VR, and much more. DSI binds satellites, spacecraft, and hardware into one global operating system, thus paving the way for new tech breakthroughs by “untethering innovation from the Earth.”</p>\n<p>Despite numerous ongoing projects such as <a href=\"https://technode.global/2022/07/12/spacechain-completes-evm-blockchain-testing-in-space-expands-space-applications-for-blockchain-customers/\">launches</a> of new satellites into space, SpaceChain can’t boast of impressive market data: the daily trading volume dangles between $2,000-3,000, market cap is slightly below $2 million, and the SPC coin is ranked #1220. However, the new SpaceChain’s CEO <a href=\"https://medium.com/blogspacechain/in-conversation-with-spacechains-ceo-cliff-beek-59e7118e84fa\">plans</a> to expand the company’s partnership to the USA (the platform is mostly Europe-based at the moment), and things may change drastically when people and capitals flood into the lunar economy. </p>\n<h3 id=\"space-nfts\">Space NFTs</h3>\n<p>Another platform democratizing access to space economy is <a href=\"https://copernicspace.com/\">Copernic Space</a>, the first Web3 marketplace for space assets. Users can buy and sell stakes in funding space missions or ownership of real assets in space. These assets are minted as NFTs and represent payload space, satellite data, and APIs.</p>\n<p>One of Copernic Space’s success cases is the &quot;Satellite Rhino&quot; NFT – a project initiated by Saving The Survivors, an organization that helps preserve the rhino population in South Africa. This partnership allows using satellite imagery and tracking technologies to protect and save dwindling rhinos. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-streamed-from-space--no-internet-required\">Bitcoin Streamed from Space – No Internet Required</h2>\n<p>Blockstream, a digital asset infrastructure company, broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain around the globe for free – anyone even in the most remote regions can sync with the network, no internet needed. </p>\n<p>All Bitcoin devotees have questioned themselves – what happens to the first cryptocurrency if the internet shuts down? Although we hope this will not be the case, there are enthusiasts who take action. Blockstream has built a web of satellites with BTC nodes in space to broadcast the Bitcoin blockchain even if the internet is damaged. </p>\n<h3 id=\"\"></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2022_10_18_T195833_265_661adc9071.png\" alt=\"blockstream coverage\" ></p>\n<p>Blockstream coverage. <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/satellite/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>The founder of Blockstream is a cypherpunk Adam Back, known as an inventor of a Bitcoin precursor Hashcash and seen by some as <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/adam-back-originator\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> himself. He brings other examples of global Bitcoin’s vulnerabilities that <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/satellite/\">Blockstream Satellite</a> helps to patch. Authoritarian regimes can potentially undermine the network; if there’s a global shutdown and card networks cease operation, critical financial needs will be put in jeopardy. Moreover, the platform allows remote areas of the Earth, where network interruptions are present or there’s no internet at all, to stay synchronized with the Bitcoin blockchain. </p>\n<p>The head of Blockstream Satellite Chris Cook describes the platform as a “passive, receive-only service,” meaning that it doesn’t allow sending transactions – but it helps everyone stay in touch with the Bitcoin network status, protect from the ground infrastructure&#39;s flaws, and enjoy enhanced security: the user’s IP address cannot be discovered, so no one can geo-locate them.</p>\n<p>Here’s how Blockstream Satellite works: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blockstream ground stations, known as &#39;teleports,&#39; are the Bitcoin network members who transmit BTC blocks to satellites. </li>\n<li>Satellites receive the signal and broadcast it across most of the Earth.</li>\n<li>If you have a small satellite antenna and a simple USB receiver, you will receive Bitcoin blocks and make sure you’re synced with the network. </li>\n<li>In turn, ground teleports are also integrated into one network and synchronized, which ensures ‘full redundancy’ of the BTC blockchain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One practical application of this scheme is lower-cost mining in remote areas. Blockstream uses satellites as a backup connection to Bitcoin and as a means to deliver its network to places with poor internet access – and these areas are often rich in energy sources that had never been used before. Thus, one can equip a solar power plant in a desert and mine Bitcoin there without any access to the Internet. </p>\n<h2 id=\"space-race-20-goes-decentralized\">Space Race 2.0 Goes Decentralized</h2>\n<p>George Pullen, co-author of the book &quot;Blockchain and The Space Economy,&quot; believes that Space Race 2.0 will not be the race as we know it – with a few superpowers competing with each other. “Space Race 2.0 is probably going to be a relay race, with people passing the baton back and forth,” says the economist. Rapidly growing extraterrestrial communities will create a sharing economy, “and the best way to set up a sharing economy is with blockchain” and new upcoming crypto projects. </p>\n<p>Historically, space exploration was one of the most inspiring pursuits of humanity. In the period of geopolitical instability and local tensions, we hope that space missions will once again become a uniting factor for people from all over the globe. And now, as space is increasingly accessible to the public and builds connections with the enthusiastic trillion-dollar crypto industry, we may witness millions of people directly involved in the new space exploration era. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":4,"name":"Industry","description":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more. \n\n","slug":"industry","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Industry - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more.

However, you need a trading strategy to combine those ways into a structure you can follow. </p>\n<p>There are many crypto trading strategies out there. But before we go any further, there are two main schools of thought you need to understand before choosing or building your own trading strategy: Technical analysis and Fundamental analysis. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_07_Academy_1_Common_Trading_Strategies_01_84f804b1ab.png\" alt=\"Common Crypto Trading Strategies\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"technical-analysis-ta\">Technical Analysis, TA</h2>\n<p>Technical analysis, also known as charting, involves studying statistics, previous trends, and numerical changes in terms of price and volume fluctuations in a bid to predict future market behavior. Most traders use this as a tool for identifying trends and favorable trading opportunities. </p>\n<p>At its core, TA is the study of traders&#39; and investors&#39; emotions (mainly fear and greed) through the relation of an asset&#39;s price to the opposing forces of demand and supply. In other words, the previous change in the price of an asset is a reflection of traders&#39; emotions, which is an important factor in the cryptocurrency market. </p>\n<p>While technical analysis is a useful tool, it is best suited to markets that operate within normal conditions (i.e., high volume and liquidity). This is because abnormal markets (low volume and liquidity) can be easily manipulated by external forces, resulting in false signals, hence rendering TA useless. </p>\n<p>To carry out TA, traders use what we call technical analysis indicators. While there are numerous indicators out there, some of the most used ones include: Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), etc. </p>\n<h2 id=\"fundamental-analysis-fa\">Fundamental Analysis, FA</h2>\n<p>In addition to technical analysis, traders use fundamental analysis to help them make more accurate decisions beyond simple statistics by analyzing qualitative factors, such as market capitalization, company management, reputation, affiliations, etc. The goal of FA is to predict the psychological impact of the price of an asset. (.i.e., do traders think an asset is overvalued or undervalued?). </p>\n<p>In fundamental analysis, predicting an asset&#39;s future price behavior involves more than its previous performance. It involves understanding the industry-specific market and considering the economic factors that may affect price behavior in that market. </p>\n<p>On that note, FA seeks to determine how less tangible and qualitative factors, such as the ones above, affect the overall performance of a project. </p>\n<p>Having discussed what technical and fundamental analysis are about, next up is a trading plan. Before we look at the common trading strategies, let&#39;s discuss what a trading plan should include. </p>\n<h2 id=\"elements-of-trading-strategies\">Elements of Trading Strategies</h2>\n<p>A trading plan must include three main elements: </p>\n<h3 id=\"market-entry-and-exit-points\"><strong>Market Entry and Exit Points</strong></h3>\n<p>A mouse click on an order DOM or a call to a broker is all it takes to execute a trade, but knowing the right point to execute that trade is a rather technical affair. </p>\n<p>Understanding the entry and exit points of a market is a crucial element of any trading strategy. You need to do your research. However, it is common practice to enter a market at its support level and exit at the next resistance level. </p>\n<h3 id=\"risk-management\"><strong>Risk Management</strong></h3>\n<p>Most traders see effective risk management as the key to a successful trading plan. This is because risks are inevitable in the crypto market. However, with a risk management plan, you can assume full control over how much risk you take on a specific trade.</p>\n<p>One way traders manage risk is by setting a stop-loss limit, a few units below the entry point or support level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"psychology-trading\"><strong>Psychology Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>Most inexperienced traders often overlook psychology when building a trading plan. But to build a successful trading plan that would maximize profit, you need to adopt a strategy that suits your psychological makeup. </p>\n<p>In other words, your trading plan must be user-friendly, understandable, and trusted by you (to promote discipline in its implementation). </p>\n<h2 id=\"active-crypto-trading-strategies\">Active Crypto Trading Strategies</h2>\n<p>As the name implies, active strategies require that you stay active within the market. That is, constantly studying charts, monitoring price behavior, and managing your portfolio. </p>\n<p>Here are some of the most common active trading strategies:</p>\n<h3 id=\"day-trading\"><strong>Day Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>Day trading involves making and closing an order within 24 hours, using hourly analysis as an aid to make decisions. This trading strategy is also referred to as high-risk trading because it often involves small price differences or large fluctuations. This can negatively affect investors that are prone to emotional trading.</p>\n<p>For advanced traders who prefer to automate trading and direct all their strategies using trading bots, crypto day trading is perfect. There are numerous website options where you can find charts with hourly and daily data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arbitrage-trading\"><strong>Arbitrage Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>This trading strategy is common in the crypto trading industry due to characteristic large fluctuations on an hourly basis. There are numerous exchanges and trading centers, enough to provide investors the room to buy fast and sell even more quickly. This strategy&#39;s game plan is to accumulate small profits from several transactions within a day or an hour. </p>\n<p>To achieve this game plan, you need to buy cheaply in one transaction and sell high on the other to make a quick profit. The upside of this strategy is that it reduces the risk of losses. But its downside is that you depend on the exchange rates on different platforms; this can make your efforts pointless if the exchange rates do not favor you. </p>\n<p>Therefore, only use this strategy if you have everything in place. Also, you need substantial knowledge of the currencies you&#39;re trading as well as how to use a trading bot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swing-trading\"><strong>Swing Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>The swing trading tactic leverages cryptocurrency graphs to point out trends within a certain period. The cryptocurrency market doesn&#39;t move in a straight line like the supply and demand chat we knew back in economics class. It moves in both directions (rise and fall). Swinging in the market refers to spotting a repeating price behavior over a specific period, then making decisions (buying or selling) to capitalize on the price behavior. </p>\n<p>This tactic is common amongst experienced traders, those with strong knowledge of the market, and the ability to understand charts and indicators. Chart platforms or mobile apps are essential for this strategy. Understanding peaks and drops are imperative to making profits with this strategy. </p>\n<h3 id=\"trend-trading\"><strong>Trend Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>The trend trading strategy is much like the swing tactic, except with a slight twist. Where swing is to short-term trading, the trend is to long-term trading. You study major events behind a particular price behavior, but this time you&#39;re more interested in long-term changes as the aim is to spot substantial price differences. </p>\n<p>This strategy has the potential to make more profits than swing trading tactics. However, it requires large investments, and you can suffer heavy losses for wrongly reading signs. And while swinging is suitable for experts, trend trading can accommodate starters as well. </p>\n<p>Bear in mind that the cryptocurrency market is volatile, and prices can change abruptly. While this strategy can make you significant profits, you can lose your money quickly as well. </p>\n<h3 id=\"scalping\"><strong>Scalping</strong></h3>\n<p>Crypto scalping is similar to arbitrage trading. This strategy is based on the idea that smaller but numerous trades a day is the best tactic to make a profit. While this trading method can work on days where there are abrupt changes in the price, it should be used sparingly. </p>\n<p>You can also indulge in this trading tactic if your goal is to make small profits while taking the lowest risks possible. It is great for starters to use this strategy for a trading test-run to get a feel of the market. </p>\n<h2 id=\"passive-crypto-trading-strategies\">Passive Crypto Trading Strategies</h2>\n<p>Unlike with active strategies, you are allowed a more hands-off approach with passive trading strategies. In other words, constantly monitoring your portfolio is not a requirement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hodl-buy--hold\"><strong>HODL (Buy & Hold)</strong></h3>\n<p>Buy and Hold in the crypto dictionary is known as HODL, which translates to hold on for your dear life in English. This strategy involves the trader looking to buy a cryptocurrency when the price is low and hold it until the market trends (buying and selling) take the price higher. </p>\n<p>According to this strategy, the price will keep rising with time, meaning the more you wait, the larger your profit. But that isn&#39;t always the case. </p>\n<p>This strategy has its merits and demerits. For the former, buying a coin and lending it out for profits is possible. You don&#39;t have to go through the hassle of complex daily analysis; instead, you concentrate on long-term indicators. </p>\n<p>On the demerit side, you stand to suffer heavy losses if your long-term analysis goes wrong. For example, bitcoin rose to a whopping $20,000 in 2018, only to fall back to $4000 at the end of the year. But in the long run, HODL is a great strategy as evident in its rebound to an all time high of $62,000 in April 2021. </p>\n<p>Note, for HODL strategy, you need a secure and trustworthy trading option. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>While trading cryptocurrency can be very lucrative, you need a robust trading strategy to ensure efficient use of capital in the face of a very volatile market. Study through the common strategies in this article, choose one that best suits you. </p>\n<p>Note that it isn&#39;t compulsory to use one strategy forever, you can evolve as you gain more trading experience. </p>\n<p>For whatever strategy, ensure consistency and strict adherence. If possible, create a trading journal to aid in analyzing your trading strategy. It is also advisable to use different strategies on different parts of your portfolio. This way you can measure different strategies’ performance to know which suits you best.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-10-13T15:58:36.852Z","createdAt":"2022-10-13T15:58:35.505Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-13T15:58:36.864Z"},{"id":1295,"title":"Vasil Hard Fork Explained: What Changes for Cardano?

This fork is a part of the massive Cardano roadmap that the team has been consistently pursuing for years. We’ve taken a deep dive into ADA in this <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/cardano-ada-review-2022\">review</a> – and here, we set out in detail the evolution of Cardano and what the Vasil hard fork means for it.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/09_12_cardano_hardfork_evolution_d1f939e563.png\" alt=\"Vasil Hard Fork Explained: What Changes for Cardano? \" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"cardano-unique-philosophy-and-strong-community\">Cardano: Unique Philosophy and Strong Community</h2>\n<p>Cardano is a digital coin that aims to become the future of money, allowing for fast peer-to-peer payments with mathematically proven security. Scalability, sustainability, and interoperability are the key characteristics inherent to Cardano. </p>\n<p>The network is unique in a way that it is based upon scientific philosophy: it is the first blockchain that was developed using peer-reviewed academic research. Cardano’s values have attracted millions of users and shaped a vibrant ADA community. According to the MBLM Top Brand Intimacy 2022 <a href=\"https://mblm.com/lab/brandintimacy-study/rankings/\">report</a>, Cardano is a top cryptocurrency brand that surpassed Bitcoin, Ford, Nestle, Xbox, and Google in terms of users’ loyalty. </p>\n<h3 id=\"how-cardano-was-conceived\">How Cardano was conceived</h3>\n<p>In 2014, an Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson realized: his and Vitalik Buterin’s views on the future of Cardano were different. He left the project to build a next-gen blockchain with his own team. Hoskinson described Bitcoin as the first-generation cryptocurrency: it enabled intermediary-free money transfers, but not much more. </p>\n<p>Generation 2 blockchains allowed for more complex, conditioned ways of value exchange, but they had poor throughput, vulnerable smart contracts, unsustainable Proof of Work consensus, bad on-chain governance resulting in hard forks.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, Hoskinson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/828741940497805314\">introduced</a> Ouroboros – a protocol that had revolutionary ideas for the crypto industry in 2017. It was meant to become the backbone of the third-generation blockchain – a faster, more reliable and scalable network.  </p>\n<p>This was the Byron Era of the Cardano <a href=\"https://roadmap.cardano.org/\">roadmap</a> – the first one out of the five. It was devoted to the foundation of the coin. </p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-on--decentralization-in-the-shelley-era\">Moving on – Decentralization in the Shelley Era</h2>\n<p>The next era focused on decentralization, and it received the name Shelley – in honor of the English novelist Mary Shelley who wrote Frankenstein. She conceived the idea of the novel in Geneva while being there with her family and Lord Byron.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_92_4fc3498015.png\" alt=\"cardano shelley\" ></p>\n<p>Mary Shelley. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mary-Wollstonecraft-Shelley\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>During the Shelley era, Cardano team implemented mechanisms that encouraged the community to create more ADA nodes, thus improving robustness and security of the blockchain. Staking pools were created, and users were given an opportunity to delegate their staked tokens. The team also launched a reward system to drive stake pools and community adoption.</p>\n<p>Shelley era set the groundwork for two hard forks that shaped Cardano as we know it today – Mary and Alonzo.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mary-hard-fork--introducing-cardano-native-assets\">Mary hard fork – introducing Cardano-native assets</h3>\n<p>An update named after Mary Shelley was implemented in March 2021, bringing Cardano closer to the Goguen smart contract era. The Mary hard fork <strong>allowed users to launch custom tokens</strong> in the blockchain, which enriched the network with new utility. </p>\n<p>These tokens have a number of features making them distinctive from ERC20 assets that we are used to. First,** they are native to Cardano blockchain and have the same status as the ADA coin** – which is different from Ethereum, where ETH and ERC20 tokens aren&#39;t equal. ADA has remained the crucial coin of the ecosystem, and Cardano has become a multi-asset blockchain. This paved the way for launching DeFi services, NFTs and stablecoins in the ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Second, <strong>Cardano tokens don’t need a smart contract to be issued.</strong> Their core logic is already implemented in the blockchain, so there’s no need for extra code. This reduces the risk of a human error: unsecured smart contracts have become a weak point of most dApp ecosystems, and their absence is meant to make tokens more reliable and secure. </p>\n<h3 id=\"alonzo-hard-fork--long-awaited-smart-contracts-launched\">Alonzo hard fork – long-awaited smart contracts launched</h3>\n<p>Even after custom tokens were enabled, it was impossible to unleash the potential of Cardano without smart contracts. Moreover, ADA positioned itself as blockchain for dApp creation – and years passed, but the team wouldn’t release the technology. Cardano was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-s-alonzo-hard-fork-was-a-success-but-real-utility-could-be-a-while\">criticized</a> for being a “smart contract platform without smart contracts”, even though it was one of the most actively developed blockchains in 2020–2021, according to a <a href=\"https://outlierventures.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blockchain-Trend-Report-Q2-20-21.pdf\">report</a>. </p>\n<p>In September 2021, smart contract tech finally went live after the Alonzo hard fork. It was a huge step in the Cardano evolution that allowed launching dApps, DEXes, and marketplaces in the ecosystem, dozens of which are functioning as of September 2022. In July, IOHK <a href=\"https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/07/04/cardano-s-approaching-vasil-upgrade-what-to-expect/\">claimed</a> there were over a thousand of projects building on Cardano, and this could even have been an underestimation.</p>\n<p>The Alonzo hard fork was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cardanostiftung/status/1437103093632622597\">hailed</a> by the Cardano Foundation as a moment when its “mission truly begins.” Cardano became a fully-functional smart contract platform <strong><em>with</em></strong> smart contracts. Its utility and usability significantly increased. </p>\n<h2 id=\"vasil-hard-fork--faster-more-scalable-cardano\">Vasil Hard Fork – Faster, More Scalable Cardano</h2>\n<p>In September 2022, we are in the Basho era of Cardano that is about scaling. The team is improving smart contracts and increasing the network&#39;s speed, throughput, and interoperability. Vasil, the hard fork of this era, is to put all these changes into effect. It has been scheduled for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1565736902204002312\">September 22nd</a>. </p>\n<p>The update was named in memory of <a href=\"http://@VStDabov\">Vasil St. Dabov</a> – a Bulgarian mathematician, Cardano ambassador, community member, and a friend of Charles Hoskinson who passed away in 2021. Vasil has left a remarkable legacy, including 10,000 trees that he has planted in his lifetime.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_93_a037e02ede.png\" alt=\"charles hoskinson vasil dabov\" ></p>\n<p>Charles Hoskinson and Vasil Dabov. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iohk_charles/status/1467662319266062340\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>The first version of smart contracts that was presented in the Alonzo hard fork allows for some lending, NFT marketplaces, and DEXes. However, a more complex DeFi hasn’t launched on Cardano since – it has higher requirements that hadn’t been met following Alonzo. </p>\n<p><strong>Vasil will allow creating decentralized exchanges, synthetic assets, and all sorts of other advanced DeFi products.</strong> It is expected that many more dApps will launch on Cardano over the next few months.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the most important updates that Vasil includes. </p>\n<h3 id=\"optimization-of-the-plutus-language\">Optimization of the Plutus language</h3>\n<p>Improving Plutus language implies allowing transactions to interact with smart contracts faster. The optimization will be implemented in accordance with community-driven Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). Let’s take a close look at one of them, CIP-33. </p>\n<p>First, some context: as mentioned before, Haskell is the main language for ADA blockchain. To make it readable for Cardano&#39;s virtual machine, Haskell is converted into Plutus scripts. </p>\n<p>The problem is that these scripts are absent on the blockchain. Every time a user sends a transaction, the algorithm uploads a script (app logic) onto the network. This means each block is stuffed with more data, so it accommodates fewer transactions, resulting in lower throughput and higher costs.</p>\n<p>CIP-33 allows pushing a script onto the chain first and then interacting with it via a <strong>reference script</strong>. Only the small reference script will have to be added to the transaction, which reduces its size significantly. The cost of interacting with a smart contract will also drop. As smaller transactions occupy less room in blocks, Cardano throughput will increase. </p>\n<h3 id=\"diffusion-pipelining\">Diffusion pipelining</h3>\n<p>Diffusion pipelining makes transactions propagate across the network faster. Currently, a block is created every 20 seconds and has to be spread in under 5 seconds. After Vasil, blocks will be propagated before they are fully validated: the time spent on diffusion and time needed for validation will overlap. This will increase the throughput of Cardano.</p>\n<p>In addition to Plutus optimization and diffusion pipelining, Plutus V2 scripts will also be upgraded. 20-30% improvements in script resource usage are expected, and Cardano will become more interoperable with other blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-cheaper-and-faster-will-cardano-become-after-vasil\">How cheaper and faster will Cardano become after Vasil?</h3>\n<p>To answer this question, Artano, a community-driven NFT marketplace on Cardano, has tested post-Vasil improvements on a preview testnet. The team compared fees for buying and selling NFTs and the sizes of these transactions. Gas fees <a href=\"https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/upgrading-to-vasil-key-development-takeaways\">dropped</a> by 76% after Vasil, and tx sizes decreased by 93%. We won’t necessarily see the same numbers on the mainnet, but the trend will surely remain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-cardano-is-preparing-for-vasil\">How Cardano Is Preparing for Vasil</h2>\n<p>Cardano has got a hard fork combinator – a system enabling smooth upgrades without system interruption or restart. It ensures that the network before and after the hard fork is the same chain. According to IOHK, the combinator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1565736910445854722\">will help</a> carry out a “<em>seamless technical transition, with no disruption for its users or a break in block production</em>.” Users don’t need to take any action.</p>\n<p>To make sure the community is prepared for the fork, Cardano has been tracking against three ecosystem metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>75% of blocks are created by the final Vasil node version (1.35.3) – the one previously released on Vasil dev net and a new pre-production environment.</li>\n<li>25 crypto exchanges accounting for 80% of ADA liquidity have upgraded. </li>\n<li>Top 10 DApps by TVL verify that they have upgraded to 1.35.3 on the pre-production chain and are ready for mainnet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cardano fans are lucky. They will enjoy cheaper and faster transactions almost immediately – compared to Ethereum users whom the Merge <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/the-merge-explained-one-step-closer-to-scalable-ethereum\">won’t please</a> with a more scalable blockchain right away. The changes that the Vasil hard fork brings promise to attract new projects into Cardano, and in the next few months, we may witness a heyday of the ADA ecosystem. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":6,"name":"News","description":"Latest cryptocurrency news.

The way finance streams work makes them beneficial for both senders and receivers.</p>\n<p>The growing number of finance streaming protocols suggests that the way money is distributed may change in the near future. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/09_06_finance_streaming_solutions_01_b85d3074ad.png\" alt=\"How Finance Streams Revolutionize Crypto Payments\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"use-cases-for-finance-streaming\">Use Cases for Finance Streaming</h2>\n<p>Here are several areas of the crypto economy where finance streaming works best. </p>\n<h3 id=\"payrolls-automating-recurring-payments\">Payrolls: Automating recurring payments</h3>\n<p>Many companies find it difficult to find a fast and trouble-free method to pay their employees, especially when the team is spread across different countries. Cryptocurrency has become a go-to solution: there’s no need to wait for lengthy bank transfers and do tons of paperwork. </p>\n<p>But what if you get tired of making multiple payrolls month after month for all your staff members, and want to set the process once and see it work automatically instead? This is what finance streaming allows you to do. Team members also profit from this model: they start earning right away and don’t have to wait until another payday to withdraw the money. All their salary is already at hand. Streaming also works perfectly if this is a temporary job and/or it is paid depending on the time spent at work. </p>\n<p>Finance streaming allows for complete transparency and financial safety: both the sender and the receiver can see at any time how much crypto has been transferred. The stream can be paused or resumed at any time.   </p>\n<h3 id=\"vesting-avoiding-routine\">Vesting: Avoiding routine</h3>\n<p>The key features of a finance stream are its controllability and a dosed distribution of funds. This is why it  works perfectly for vesting: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investors</strong> can gradually earn tokens for their support of the project. </li>\n<li><strong>Supporters and employees</strong> can be easily and fairly vested with a set cliff period. </li>\n<li><strong>Grant funds</strong> can be distributed progressively so that money is spent more rationally and the team doesn’t run out of funds prematurely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finance streams eliminate routine in vesting: once you set up the process, it runs continuously until you want to pause or stop it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pay-per-minute-services-a-fair-play\">Pay-per-minute services: A fair play</h3>\n<p>Streams allow customers to pay exactly for the time they’ve been using a service. Thus they don’t lose their money on equipment rental, car parking, or co-working if they’ve already paid but hadn’t used the service during the whole period. </p>\n<p>The same applies to subscription models: since you can pause the stream at any time, you pay just for the time you’ve been using the app. And this model has its benefits for businesses, too: developers can instantly see changes in user behavior and subscriptions when they implement changes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"airdrops-reducing-new-tokens-volatility\">Airdrops: Reducing new token’s volatility</h3>\n<p>Finance streams allow crypto projects to conduct airdtops without a rapid decrease in tokens’ prices. </p>\n<p>Airdrops stand as a part of the marketing strategy — projects distribute their tokens to attract traffic and draw attention to their platform. But if the team sends out all its tokens at once, users may start selling them right away, thus dumping the price. Distributing tokens during 3 months or longer will help avoid instant sales and volatility. Thousands of users will receive their crypto transparently and, again, in a controllable way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"game-mechanics-incentivizing-users\">Game mechanics: Incentivizing users</h3>\n<p>Increasing the engagement of users is another thing that token streams can do. Here’s how it works: developers receive money proportionally to the time gamers have spent in the game, rather than their occasional purchases. This allows converting users from unpredictable to constant players and increases the time that they spend playing.  </p>\n<p>The money stream can be implemented here as a subscription or in-game assets rental. Besides being advantageous for developers, this model also <a href=\"https://medium.com/@roke.to/financial-streaming-for-the-game-mechanics-get-more-involved-users-8149cd6303ce\">reduces</a> the entry point for users: they deposit funds for active play time only and don’t have the feeling they’ve paid for something they don’t use. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-finance-streaming-works\">How Finance Streaming Works</h2>\n<p>Streams change the very nature of how money is paid. They let you pay continuously over a long period of time: senders and receivers track the money flow and can control it by halting, resuming, or stopping. </p>\n<p>After you log in the streaming protocol with your Web3 wallet, you can set up a stream: set the token, duration, and wallet address of the receiver. From this moment, you can start sending money in real time. See the dashboard to track and control the stream. The recipient can withdraw the accrued funds at any moment. </p>\n<h2 id=\"3-finance-streaming-protocols\">3 Finance Streaming Protocols</h2>\n<h3 id=\"roketo\">Roketo</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_89_bba45cc8c4.png\" alt=\"roketo crypto finance\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/roketostream\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.roke.to\">Roketo</a> is a NEAR-based platform that boosts token utility through persistent, time-distributed transfers. It has attracted over 5,000 customers, made 7,000 streams, and sent over $1M of funds in only one year since its launch. </p>\n<p>Roketo was created during the NEAR’s MetaBUIDL Hackathon in 2021 where it won the competition between young developers. In 2022, the service released its dApp, passed a 3-rd party security audit by BlockSec, and got $900K of investment. </p>\n<p>Roketo can be easily built in any NEAR-based protocol. The service positions itself as a developer-first platform – it allows you to build and deploy with its detailed documentation and 100% open-source SDK (coming soon). Roketo makes it possible to build a range of new powerful DeFi products and financial instruments through token streaming. </p>\n<p>It is an end-to-end solution for individuals and DAOs. Roketo gives full control over the finance stream to both sender and the receiver: the transfer can be stopped and resumed at any moment, and it is cryptographically guaranteed that the recipient will get their tokens. </p>\n<p>Here’s how Roketo is different from other crypto payment services: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full control.</strong> Both a sender and a receiver have complete control over a finance stream: a transfer can be stopped and resumed at any moment, and it is cryptographically guaranteed that the recipient will get their tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>For individuals and organizations.</strong> Roketo is an end-to-end solution that caters to individuals and DAOs. </li>\n<li><strong>Low transaction fees.</strong> NEAR boasts gas fees of just a few US cents, so it costs less than $1 to set up a stream on Roketo. This makes it profitable to create hundreds of streams simultaneously, and receivers are able to withdraw funds multiple times. </li>\n<li><strong>High speed.</strong> Funds accrue every second and can be withdrawn at the same moment they’ve arrived. </li>\n<li><strong>Transparency.</strong> All members of the process see the dynamic of the money flow in the dashboard. Every stream has a unique URL that makes it easier to track it. This openness facilitates financial planning and tax payments. </li>\n<li><strong>Simple interface.</strong> It takes less than a second to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@roke.to/how-to-create-your-first-roketo-stream-96cb8446f9a4\">set up a stream</a> – set the details in 3 steps and you’re good to go. Pause, resume, stop, extend streams at any moment. The history is available in stream details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"sablier-finance\">Sablier Finance</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_90_fd2e5972b5.png\" alt=\"sablier financial streaming service\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sablier.finance/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sablier.finance\">Sablier Finance</a> is a streaming protocol that runs on the Ethereum network. It was developed in 2019 with grant support from the Maker protocol. Sablier’s smart contracts are simple as they only contain the information about the time of stream creation and recipient’s wallet. </p>\n<p>The service allows you to get rid of the hassle of making payments over and over again. Once you make a one-time deposit and the stream starts, the money flows “without you lifting a finger again.” Receivers see how much they’ve earned in real-time.</p>\n<p>One of the Sablier’s customers is <a href=\"https://medium.com/sablier/case-study-rook-labs-f03ce374c096\">Rook Labs</a>, an organization working at the Rook Protocol. Their solution captures and redistributes MEV, or Miner Extractable Value (Ethereum&#39;s “invisible tax”), to the users and protocols that create it.</p>\n<p>Rook Labs “is actually not a company” – but a team spread across the world, with some of its members working fully remotely. Moreover, some of the employees are anonymous, so even the platform’s CEO doesn’t know their names. This situation is problematic in 2 ways: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The employer has to do a lot of manual work – create monthly payrolls for each of 30+ team members, </li>\n<li>Employees have to trust their project’s managers in terms of sending timely payouts. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sablier allows Rook Labs to solve this problem. A stream created in just 30 seconds can run during the whole year, liberating the team from recurring paperwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"superfluid\">Superfluid</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_91_a9d533cf94.png\" alt=\"superfluid financial streaming\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/superfluid-finance\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.superfluid.finance\">Superfluid</a> is a protocol that allows for creating programmable cash flows on the Ethereum, Polygon, and xDAI networks – the project calls this the “new subscription-based economy on-chain.” In 2021, Superfluid raised a $9 million funding round, which the platform will use to expand the team and build an entire ecosystem of new “real-time financial applications.”</p>\n<p>The service lets you do multiple tasks in one single transaction – for instance, fund several projects at a time. This is possible with a Super Token, a Superfluid’s ERC-20 asset with increased functionality. Here&#39;s how it works: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You mint a Super Token, for instance, DAIx on Polygon. This is done by upgrading your Dai tokens – the same way that ETH is transformed into WETH.</li>\n<li>To run the stream, you sign one transaction. Once it is confirmed, the money from your Superfluid balance starts ticking down and the tokens in the receiver’s account begin to tick up. </li>\n<li>Since there’s only one transaction, no gas is needed to run multiple streams or modify the existing stream. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-crypto-payments\">The Future of Crypto Payments</h2>\n<p>Finance streaming is not just a handy feature. It’s a whole new vision of payments, a different paradigm that changes the way employees receive their salaries, users pay for services, and projects airdrop their tokens. As the Superfluid’s co-founder and CEO Francesco George Renzi believes, a new generation of crypto natives who will be paid in streaming money will emerge soon.</p>\n<p>Besides Roketo, Sablier Finance, and Superfluid, there are many other players on different blockchains – <a href=\"https://llamapay.io\">LlamaPay</a> on Ethereum, <a href=\"https://calamus.finance\">Calamus Finance</a> on Polygon, and <a href=\"https://streamflow.finance\">StreamFlow</a> on Solana. The increasing number of finance streaming services may be the sign that the new trend in how crypto payments are made is emerging. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-09-09T12:49:43.856Z","createdAt":"2022-09-09T12:49:40.806Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-09T12:49:43.869Z"},{"id":1278,"title":"Ava Labs and Roche Freedman Law Firm Evil Conspiracy Revealed","description":"Shocking evidence revealed at the end of last month shows how Ava Labs has been promoting its token and harming competitors over the past few years.","slug":"ava-labs-and-roche-freedman-law-firm-evil-conspiracy-revealed","metaTitle":"Ava Labs and Roche Freedman Law Firm Evil Conspiracy Revealed","metaDescription":"Shocking evidence revealed at the end of last month shows how Ava Labs has been promoting its token and harming competitors over the past few years.","featuredImage":{"id":5822,"name":"ava labs roche freedman.png","alternativeText":"Ava Labs and Roche Freedman Law Firm Evil Conspiracy Revealed","caption":"","hash":"ava_labs_roche_freedman_20ab6a2b85","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/ava_labs_roche_freedman_20ab6a2b85.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_ava_labs_roche_freedman_20ab6a2b85.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_ava_labs_roche_freedman_20ab6a2b85.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_ava_labs_roche_freedman_20ab6a2b85.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_ava_labs_roche_freedman_20ab6a2b85.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>According to the <a href=\"https://cryptoleaks.info/case-no-3?utm_campaign=Research%20newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=63829568&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-881l_-9FnktzSAl6sD7LV6a95Ts0JqglS5Gxb02HwPRMNOZqubMtwORgcaHmazpi_OQTN4znNBuuq9Rm2yQqo-ITLabg&amp;utm_content=63829568&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">investigation</a>, the blockchain company’s CEO Emin Gün Sirer made a deal with the American law firm Roche Freedman a few years ago. In exchange for a large amount of Ava Labs stock and its native token AVAX, the law firm leader Kyle Roche agreed to promote the Avalanche blockchain by suing its crypto competitors. </p>\n<p>Roche Freedman has been taking advantage of the American class action system litigating against numerous blockchain organizations and getting access to their confidential information. By suing crypto companies such as Solana, Kyle Roche has managed to kill two birds with one stone: damage the competitor&#39;s reputation, as well as lure regulators such as the SEC and CFTC away from Ava Labs. As a result, the Avalanche Network still hasn’t caught the attention of the SEC despite its highly commercial behavior. Besides, amid the failures of other crypto companies, the AVAX token has been growing in price.</p>\n<p>Kyle Roche admits that he uses litigation as a for-profit opportunity which he considers to be an “underused tool”.

While Ethereum’s Merge has seen far more publicity, the network might not be the only one to undergo a major upgrade shortly.</p>\n<p>Hoskinson revealed that progress on the fork is going smoothly, and fast enough that he anticipates Vasil will go live sometime in September. The exact date of the upgrade depends on a few other factors such as if any significant bugs show up at some point. However, besides a minor glitch in the backlog, there are no issues at the moment. </p>\n<p>Additionally, Cardano has to ensure three of the top five exchanges upgrade their systems before they can move ahead with Vasil. The platform is also looking to achieve 75% block production by stake pool operators before the hard fork commences. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/weekly_recap_template_565f7de67d.png\" alt=\"Weekly Recap: Cardano and Ethereum Upgrades Set for September\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"tornado-cash-dev-denied-bail-as-judge-rules-90-day-imprisonment\">Tornado Cash Dev Denied Bail as Judge Rules 90-day Imprisonment</h2>\n<p>Following a ruling from a Netherlands judge, Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash dev may remain incarcerated for up to 90 days. Earlier this month, Dutch authorities took Pertsev into custody. This came shortly after the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control blacklisted crypto mixer Tornado Cash. </p>\n<p>On account of Pertsev’s ties to the sanctioned privacy protocol, Netherlands’ Fiscal Information and Investigation Service conducted his arrest. The agency later shared a release explaining the move and details of their probe into Tornado Cash. According to their report, Pertsev had taken part “in concealing criminal flows” as well as aiding money laundering operations. </p>\n<p>On Wednesday, August 24, about two weeks after his arrest, Pertsev attended a court hearing in Den Bosch. The presiding judge rejected bail requests from the dev’s lawyers, eventually ruling that he would be detained for 90 more days. Notably, Pertsev is yet to be charged with a crime, a point that has sparked further outrage within the crypto community. </p>\n<h2 id=\"binance-and-mastercard-partner-to-enable-card-options-for-crypto-payments\">Binance and Mastercard Partner to Enable Card Options for Crypto Payments</h2>\n<p>According to a statement from CEO Michael Miebach, payments giant Mastercard is joining forces with crypto exchange platform Binance. The goal of the alliance is to push crypto payments for daily purchases. Hence, the companies are working together to enable crypto users to make digital asset payments using their MasterCard.</p>\n<p>Miebach explained that by bringing crypto to daily purchases, they can explore the full potential of blockchain technology:</p>\n<p><em>“We can unlock the full potential of blockchain technology when we make it easier to access + easier to use. One way we do that is by bringing crypto to everyday purchases.”</em></p>\n<p>The CEO’s statement comes as Mastercard and Binance <a href=\"https://www.mastercard.com/news/latin-america/en/newsroom/press-releases/pr-en/2022/august/binance-and-mastercard-launch-prepaid-card-in-argentina-to-bridge-cryptocurrencies-and-everyday-purchases/\">roll</a> out the Binance Card in Argentina. Binance customers who are also residents of the country can use the card to buy items and pay bills in crypto. Of course, they will first need to complete verification using a valid form of identification. </p>\n<h2 id=\"tornado-cash-addresses-remain-active-on-tether-despite-treasury-ban\">Tornado Cash Addresses Remain Active on Tether Despite Treasury Ban</h2>\n<p>The team behind stablecoin ecosystem <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tether\">Tether</a> made a <a href=\"https://tether.to/en/tether-holds-firm-on-decision-not-to-freeze-tornado-cash-addresses-awaits-law-enforcement-instruction/\">post</a> last Wednesday that they would not freeze any Tornado Cash addresses. This is despite a number of punitive <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/arrested-tornado-cash-developer-blamed-for-having-links-to-russian-secret-agency\">measures</a> against Tornado Cash and parties related to it.</p>\n<p>Tether’s Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino explained in the release that the network typically complies with official requests. Tether reportedly does not exempt US Treasury Department sanctions from its “world-class compliance program.” </p>\n<p>However, since the sanction, the stablecoin network has not received any orders to act against Tornado Cash. Hence, without a direct request from the authorities, the team will not blacklist any Tornado Cash addresses. Tether claims acting on its own could disrupt official investigations. </p>\n<p>The post also noted competitor Circle blacklisting Tornado Cash addresses not long after the treasury sanctioned the crypto mixer. Tether believes Circle may have moved prematurely if they acted without a direct order.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-whales-move-tokens-to-on-exchange-addresses-ahead-of-the-merge\">Ethereum Whales Move Tokens to On-Exchange Addresses Ahead of the Merge</h2>\n<p>On the 15th of September, Ethereum will officially commence its transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. However, with the Merge just up ahead, bullish price action surrounding the network appears to be slowing down. Several Ethereum whales have been moving their holdings onto exchange-based addresses. </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1562574137876365313?ref_src=\">data</a> from crypto research company Santiment, the top 10 non-exchange addresses have seen their holdings fall 11% in the past 3 months. Meanwhile, the top 10 exchange addresses have continued to bulk up with a 78% increase. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the date for the upgrade emerged, Ethereum’s native token <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Ether (ETH)</a> embarked on a bull run. Ethereum broke past $2000 to record a 6-month high but failed to remain within the region. Presently, the token appears to be running out of steam and some analysts believe this will worsen once the Merge actually takes place. </p>\n<h2 id=\"sudorare-devs-conduct-a-rugpull-scam-users-out-of-820k\">SudoRare Devs Conduct a Rugpull, Scam Users Out of $820K</h2>\n<p>Early last week, the team behind NFT-focused AMM protocol SudoRare allegedly carried out a rug pull. The anonymous developers made off with 519 Ethereum tokens, supposedly scamming users of about $820,000 in total. After the heist, the team took down the project’s official website and social media accounts.</p>\n<p>According to SudoRare’s etherscan data, the perpetrators first took out about $315,700 in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/weth-erc20\">wETH</a>, $200,000 in XMON, and $314,700 in LOOKS from the platform’s account. They exchanged the tokens for ETH and transferred the funds to 3 Ethereum wallets. Blockchain security company Peckshield has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1562031961857818624?s=20&amp;t=KMxv7QCXMSy_UAcHWF6kbw\">discovered</a> links to the centralized exchange platform Kraken.</p>\n<p>Reportedly, SudoRare was live for only about 6 hours before the scam went down. Also interestingly, speculations that the platform could be a fraud had made rounds on Twitter before the actual event confirmed the rumors.  The platform originally emerged as a fork of NFT marketplaces, LooksRare and SudoSwap.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":6,"name":"News","description":"Latest cryptocurrency news.

Players get rewarded in various ways: through new coins and tokens, more powerful characters, ownership of land, and NFTs. Blockchain games are significantly different from traditional video games that are centralized in nature and only exist on a company server somewhere in the world. Your in-game progress and everything you have achieved remains in the control of the creators, and outside of those walls, there is nothing you can do with it.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the GameFi industry has realized that its players are the ones creating value and giving importance to their games. Therefore, they need to be incentivized and given actual ownership of those virtual creations. The earn-to-play model allows buying, selling, trading, borrowing, or giving away digital items on marketplaces that don’t have to be connected to the game itself. The cryptocurrencies earned for your progress can be sold on crypto exchanges like <strong><a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>Billions of dollars are being invested in the GameFi sector. <strong><a href=\"https://splinterlands.com/\">Splinterlands</a></strong> has been one of the hottest games for several years now. Let’s see how you can benefit from playing this action-packed game and what it’s all about.   </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/08_11_Splinterlands_review_01_9914af1239.png\" alt=\"How to Play and Earn with Splinterlands\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-splinterlands\">What Is Splinterlands?</h2>\n<p>Splinterlands is a collectible NFT card game released in 2018. The game runs on the <strong>Hive</strong> <strong>blockchain</strong> and consists of automated battles in multiplayer mode between different people. Each card is an individual NFT owned by a real player.</p>\n<p>Splinterlands was created out of the disappointment of traditional card games. They allowed the companies behind them to remain in absolute control and even restrict, delete, or suspend certain users for supposed term violations. But with the decentralized nature of the blockchain, that is no longer a concern.</p>\n<p>In its beginning, this game was named <strong>Steem Monsters</strong> and was launched on the Steem blockchain. The name change didn’t occur before April 2019, and the migration to Hive happened in 2020.</p>\n<p>The original Steem Monsters series was a great success. From May until November 2018, it had already seen over 1 million battles. Before 2019, the company had paid out over $25.000 to its players in tournament mode, while the card sales on the official marketplace reached <a href=\"https://docs.splinterlands.com/company/timeline/history\">$1 million</a>. </p>\n<p>Several important milestones were reached in 2020: Splinterlands integrated with Ethereum, the official mobile app was launched, and support was added for many cryptocurrencies, plus PayPal. In 2021, the company launched new bridges to Binance Smart Chain and the WAX blockchain. The increased popularity among gamers resulted in tournament prizes of over $200.000 being awarded since the game’s release. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-team-and-founders-of-splinterlands\">The Team and Founders of Splinterlands</h3>\n<p>Splinterlands has two co-founders: <strong>Dr. Jesse “Aggroed” Reich</strong>, and <strong>Matthew “Yabapmatt” Rosen</strong>. Jesse is the company CEO, while Matthew is the CPO. Dr. Reich is a longtime gamer and designer. Matt is an experienced blockchain developer, computer programmer, and game designer.</p>\n<p>The two of them met in 2018 while working on a completely different project. Their interests in gaming made them become partners and develop the Splinterlands card game. Besides these two co-founders, the company has over 60 employees and an unknown number of advisors, partners, and investors. </p>\n<p>It’s important to mention the CTO <strong>“Hardpoint,”</strong> <strong>Nate Aguila,</strong> the Creative Director, eSports Manager <strong>“Weirdbeard,”</strong> and <strong>“Chatter,”</strong> who is the Head of Marketing.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-play-splinterlands\">How to Play Splinterlands</h3>\n<p>Splinterlands is available for desktop, Android, and iOS devices. The initial registration is free and gives the player a starter pack of NFT battle cards. A tutorial will walk you through the basics and allow you to play demo matches to get the hang of it. But to earn Splinterlands crypto rewards, join tournaments, and go into battle, you must pay $10 to buy the <strong><a href=\"https://docs.splinterlands.com/summoners-spellbook\">Summoner’s Spellbook</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>Once you have made the purchase, you can start collecting the in-game tokens in several ways. It’s important to remember that Splinterlands is a strategic game focusing on tactical battle preparation and placing characters in strategically vital positions. The battles themselves are fully automated. </p>\n<p>For each round, a player can pick <strong>1</strong> <strong>Summoner</strong> and <strong>6</strong> <strong>Monsters</strong>. The summoner summons their fighters, but only if they belong to the same team as him. These teams or groups are known as **splinters, **and there are 7 different kinds: fire, water, earth, life, death, dragon, and neutral splinters.</p>\n<p>The fighters are known as monsters. All monsters have their own strengths and abilities denoted in stats for <strong>health, armor, speed, and attack</strong>. These qualities determine their chances of winning in battles. </p>\n<p>The winner of each round receives rating points and Splinterlands crypto rewards. There are a few ways you can do that.</p>\n<p>Splinterlands’ native currency is called <strong>Dark Energy Crystals (DEC)</strong>. It can be earned by winning <strong>battles</strong> in ranked mode against other players. Depending on the level you are at, the level of the opponent, and your collection power and rating points, you can earn more or less of DEC. </p>\n<p>Another way to earn Dark Energy Crystals is by <strong>selling your cards (NFTs)</strong> on the Splinterlands marketplace. Rare cards can reach prices of thousands of dollars, while the most common ones are only worth a few cents. </p>\n<p>The DEC Splinterlands token is awarded for <strong>completing daily quests</strong> and as <strong>the end-of-season rewards</strong>. Players can complete specific tasks daily and receive new NFTs or Dark Energy Crystals as an incentive. When a season ends (after 12 to 16 days), players can unlock chest rewards depending on their league level and overall ranking. Better rewards await those playing in the highest of leagues. </p>\n<p>Winning <strong>tournaments</strong> earns the most tokens. They take place every day and have an entry fee to participate. However, the best ones issue rewards of hundreds and thousands of USD worth of crypto.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the market section has a feature that allows players to <strong>rent out their cards</strong> and receive daily rewards according to the character’s strengths and abilities. </p>\n<h2 id=\"splinterlands-roadmap\">Splinterlands Roadmap</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_b606920c56.jpeg\" alt=\"splinterlands roadmap\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.splinterlands.com/platform/roadmap\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>The team working on the Splinterlands product has released <a href=\"https://docs.splinterlands.com/platform/roadmap\">an official roadmap</a> explaining the current development state and what can be expected in the future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The developers decided to increase the ranked battle rewards in Q2 2022, offering players greater potential to earn more crypto.</li>\n<li>Owners of SPS tokens had the chance to vote for validator nodes that verify transactions, control foundation funds, and maintain the network. </li>\n<li>Ranked battles now have two modes: wild and modern. The difference between them is in the types of cards that can be featured.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://leofinance.io/@finguru/splinterlands-revealed-their-roadmap-for-2022-23-and-i-can-t-keep-calm\">Q3 of 2022</a> will introduce the following novelties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will become possible to sell and purchase parcels of land on the official Splinterlands marketplace. </li>\n<li>A new type of card will be introduced called Riftwatchers. These can only be bought with the SPS Splinterlands token.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Q4 2022, the team plans to release a new user interface for the wild and modern battles. Additionally, a physical meetup will be organized in Las Vegas on 8-9 October 2022, titled Splinterfest.</p>\n<p>Some new changes are in the works for Q1 2023 as well. Rebellion cards will be released to the community. An upgrade is expected for the Lands feature that foresees the creation of new buildings and land areas.   </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-3-tokens-of-splinterlands\">The 3 Tokens of Splinterlands</h2>\n<p>This card game comes with <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/splinterlands/#Splinterlands_Tokenomics\">3 different cryptocurrencies</a>. Each asset has its own use case. The tokens you will come across are <strong>Dark Energy Crystals</strong> (<strong>DEC</strong>), <strong>Splinterlands</strong> <strong>Credits</strong> (<strong>CREDITS</strong>), and <strong>Splintershards</strong> (<strong>SPS</strong>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"dark-energy-crystals-dec\">Dark Energy Crystals (DEC)</h3>\n<p>The main in-game currency is DEC. Being victorious in battles earns players new Dark Energy Crystals. This Splinterlands token is pegged to the USD in the ratio of 1000 DEC = $1. During times of volatility, the fixed daily rewards pool of 1 million DEC is adjusted to maintain the same value. </p>\n<p>Dark Energy Crystals are burned when NFTs are sold on the marketplace to preserve a steady price for the asset. DEC tokens are not just used within the game of Splinterlands. They are also listed and can be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. </p>\n<h3 id=\"splinterland-credits-credits\">Splinterland Credits (CREDITS)</h3>\n<p>Credits are somewhat different from DEC. They have no value outside the game and can’t be bought or sold on 3rd-party platforms. These tokens have the same market value as DEC (1000 CREDITS is worth $1) and can be used to purchase or lend cards and NFTs on the official Splinterlands marketplace. </p>\n<p>Additionally, the referral system uses CREDITS to pay out commissions. This digital asset can be bought with PayPal or a long list of established cryptocurrencies.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"splintershards-sps\">Splintershards (SPS)</h3>\n<p>SPS is Splinterlands’ official governance token. Splintershards is a BEP-20 coin that can be staked and used for voting on community proposals. Each token represents one vote on the network. A 1/3 of the SPS total supply was airdropped to active players following their in-game collection power. </p>\n<p>The game has thousands of active nodes that validate transactions and receive block rewards. These validators use a <strong>Delegated Proof of Stake</strong> <strong>(DPoS)</strong> consensus algorithm with open-source software.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wallets--exchanges\">Wallets & Exchanges</h3>\n<h4 id=\"dark-energy-crystals\">Dark Energy Crystals</h4>\n<p>Dark Energy Crystals are available in 2 forms: <strong>ERC-20</strong> and <strong>TRC-10 tokens</strong>.

In 2021, this indicator increased by 178%, growing from 106M to 295M. The adoption rate seems to be accelerating year by year. </p>\n<p>Behind these numbers stand solutions that facilitate daily use of crypto – indispensable to the mass audience that seeks convenience rather than sophisticated technology. In the meantime, crypto adoption is largely driven by developing countries where digital currencies serve primarily as a means of financial protection and freedom. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, the growing number of use cases for cryptocurrency is the factor that pushes its adoption forward. Let’s review the signs indicating that digital assets are becoming more accessible and popular worldwide. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/08_05_Signs_of_Crypto_Adoption_1_1be939d4cf.png\" alt=\"Signs of Crypto Adoption: Is Bitcoin Taking Over The World?\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"for-users-new-daily-use-cases\">For Users: New Daily Use Cases</h2>\n<p>Back in the early 2010’s, cryptocurrency was evolving in an isolated environment: there were hardly any ways to use it in everyday life. Digital coins were of interest to decentralization enthusiasts who were OK with the lack of real-world use cases. Today’s solutions open cryptocurrency to anyone and everyone. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ordering-a-taxi-drive-in-the-binance-app\">Ordering a taxi drive in the Binance app</h3>\n<p>In June 2022, Binance Pay announced its partnership with Splyt superapp enabler, which gave all Binancians an opportunity to book over 300,000 trips, tickets, and entertainment services in 150 countries right within the Binance app. </p>\n<p>Binance Pay is a user-to-user cryptocurrency payment system that allows Binance users to send crypto to each other, and Splyt is a solution that lets businesses integrate popular services in their platforms. With this partnership, Binance becomes the world&#39;s first crypto exchange that offers ride-hailing: customers can order a taxi, pay for bike rental or other services with cryptocurrency, and also use Alipay, Grab, and Booking.com without leaving Binance. </p>\n<h3 id=\"crypto-debit-cards\">Crypto debit cards</h3>\n<p>There are still few businesses that accept cryptocurrency, but most of them allow fiat Visa and MasterCard payments. So why not create a crypto debit card, enabling the digital coins’ owners to use their funds wherever they want? </p>\n<p>In 2022, there’s already many solutions of this kind. Investopedia <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-bitcoin-debit-cards-5114761\">reviews</a> 8 crypto credit cards, and each has its pros in cons: for instance, Binance card allows earning up to 8% cashback and there are no issuance or monthly fees, whereas the BitPay card is only available for U.S. residents, and the Coinbase card demands creating a verified account on the exchange. </p>\n<h3 id=\"invest-in-bitcoin-from-every-purchase\">Invest in Bitcoin from every purchase</h3>\n<p>Cash App is one of the most popular solutions allowing you to manage fiat money and cryptocurrency under one roof. The application was developed by Block, Inc. – the company co-founded by Jack Dorsey, the ex-CEO and founder of Twitter and a strong Bitcoin proponent. Cash App allowed crypto deposits back in 2018, and by May 2022, over 10 million app users have bought Bitcoin. </p>\n<p>This summer, Cash App enabled Round Ups – a feature that rounds each purchase up to the nearest dollar and invests the difference in Bitcoin, stocks, or ETFs. Here’s how it works: let’s say you bought a book that costs $9.50. The app will charge you $10, of which $0.5 will be directed to your Bitcoin wallet. These expenses are almost unnoticeable, but they allow you to save a decent stash of crypto by the end of each month without any effort. </p>\n<h3 id=\"learn-about-crypto-and-earn-rewards\">Learn about crypto and earn rewards</h3>\n<p>Learn-to-earn is a mechanic widely <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/play-move-learn-to-earn-how-to-monetize-your-passions\">used</a> in various crypto platforms: they offer you to take brief educational courses on digital coins, complete quizzes, and earn rewards for your activity. In 2022, this model is being embraced by a larger circle of fintech apps. </p>\n<p>Revolut, an international mobile banking application, has recently launched an L2E program to educate its users in cryptocurrency: users take courses, complete tests, and get rewarded in their Revolut crypto wallets. The quizzes were created in partnership with Polkadot, so users receive their earnings in DOT coins. Currently, two tests are available – on the fundamentals of cryptocurrency and the basics of the Polkadot ecosystem. Users can earn up to $15. </p>\n<h2 id=\"for-businesses-instant-crypto-payments-are-possible-now\">For Businesses: Instant Crypto Payments Are Possible Now</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, there was a popular talk that even though crypto was invented as an alternative currency, you couldn’t buy a coffee with it: transactions are confirmed too slowly, and network fees are too high. Finally, this is changing today with the adoption of the Lightning Network – a system that allows for instant and ultra-cheap Bitcoin transactions. </p>\n<p>This July, a few major franchises in Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory in Europe, have started accepting Bitcoin via Lightning. For Costa Coffee, Card Factory and Hotel Chocolat, such transactions cost even less than those processed by Visa or MasterCard, and for customers, they offer a great experience: you simply scan a QR code and the payment is settled in seconds.</p>\n<p>Prior to launching the Round Ups feature in 2022, Cash App has enabled the Lightning Network as well. Users can send Bitcoin to all BTC addresses including those outside Cash App. “Buy tacos, tip your favorite Twitter comedian, or send a friend money abroad – anywhere that accepts lightning,” the app suggests. </p>\n<p>However, many businesses still hesitate from integrating crypto payment solutions – for the reasons of misinformation and regulatory concerns, experts say. Education in crypto payments could encourage businesses to accept digital coins and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/education-in-crypto-payments-will-spark-mass-adoption-says-checkout-com-exec\">spark</a> their popularity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crypto-mass-adoption-in-emerging-markets\">Crypto Mass Adoption In Emerging Markets</h2>\n<p>At the Blockchain Economy Istanbul event held this July, cryptocurrency was discussed in regard to emerging markets. It was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-tackles-unique-challenges-in-emerging-markets\">encouraged</a> to focus on developing countries as they encompass 85% of the world’s population, for which crypto is a vital need rather than just a great financial tool. </p>\n<h3 id=\"venezuela-playing-axie-infinity-to-pay-bills\">Venezuela: playing Axie Infinity to pay bills</h3>\n<p>Digital coins have gained tremendous popularity in Venezuela, where the local economy is suffocating from hyperinflation, and the state currency Bolivar is practically worthless. For many, crypto has become the only way to save their funds, so digital currencies have achieved a great level of adoption: they are not only accepted at the airports but also used as means of daily payments and family remittances. Some Venezuelans have started playing Axie Infinity to make a living.</p>\n<p>A crucial role in Venezuelan crypto ecosystem belongs to Reserve – an application that allows users to exchange Bolivar for U.S. Dollars via RSV stablecoin. The app has already attracted 100,000 weekly users across Latin America, and Venezuelan government is trying to resist it with a 20% tax on cryptocurrencies — this step is supposed to encourage the population to switch to state-based Digital Bolivar. </p>\n<h3 id=\"afghanistan-bitcoin-salary-for-unbanked-women\">Afghanistan: Bitcoin salary for unbanked women</h3>\n<p>Another country where crypto plays a literally vital role is Afghanistan. A good example to illustrate this is the case of Roya Mahboob, a famous Afghani activist and one of the few female tech CEOs that had to flee the country in September 2021 as Talibs took power. In her company, Afghan Citadel Software Company (ACSC), half of the staff are women who don’t have access to bank accounts anymore. Mahboob has been paying them in Bitcoin since last year.  </p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/\">Global Crypto Adoption Index</a> by Chainalysis, cryptocurrency is most widely spread in developing countries such as Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Kenya. Venezuela ranks 7th, and the USA occupies the 8th place. In the Top 20, there is no single country from the EU. According to the report, cryptocurrency usage in emerging markets is mainly driven by P2P platforms. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_84_3148ccc489.png\" alt=\"crypto adoption by country\" ></p>\n<p>Crypto adoption by country between 2020 and 2021. <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/\">Image source</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"countries-adopting-cryptocurrency\">Countries Adopting Cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country on Earth to make Bitcoin a legal tender. In April this year, the Central African Republic repeated the move. Can we say that the governments across the globe foster crypto currency adoption by making it the second official currency? </p>\n<p>In the Crypto.com <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf\">report</a> with cryptocurrency adoption statistics, it is predicted that cryptocurrency will become legal tender the fastest in developing countries. <em>“More nations facing a highly inflationary economy and depreciating currency may adopt cryptocurrency as legal tender, following the example of El Salvador,”</em> says the report.</p>\n<p>However, there is a difference between adoption and legalization. In Vietnam, the country with the highest acceptance rate, cryptocurrency exists in a gray zone, and the government is attempting to ban it. On the contrary, El Salvador couldn’t boast a great crypto adoption rate before 2021, but its authorities were enthusiastic enough about Bitcoin to make it a legal tender. </p>\n<p>This decision was not warmly welcomed by all proponents of crypto adoption, though. While Bitcoin maximalists hailed President Nayib Bukele, Vitalik Buterin said it was <em>“reckless”</em> to push Bitcoin to millions of Salvadorans as they are now at a huge risk of getting scammed or robbed without prior education. The Ethereum co-founder emphasized that making it obligatory for businesses to accept crypto <em>“is contrary to the ideals of freedom that are supposed to be so important to the crypto space.”</em></p>\n<p>Mr. Whale, a crypto analyst with 523K followers on Twitter, said that Bitcoin as a legal tender is a “Trojan horse” for citizens of El Salvador: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_85_da77fb77ab.png\" alt=\"bitcoin tweet\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptoWhale/status/1439456645378084864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1439456645378084864%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fforklog.com%2Fhudshij-koshmar-satoshi-ili-finansovaya-revolyutsiya-chem-obernetsya-legalizatsiya-bitkoina-v-salvadore%2F\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>The International Monetary Fund sees nothing good in El Salvador’s policy as well and even calls on Bukele to reverse his decision. The IMF states that given the high volatility of BTC price, its use as an official currency entails risks for financial stability and integrity. President Bukele said he disagreed with the IMF. </p>\n<p>The decision to adopt Bitcoin received mixed reactions by the citizens of El Salvador: the unbanked ones were given the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/how-crypto-partners-with-sport-to-help-adoption\">opportunity</a> to run a business, while the others were pushed to protest. It is yet to be discovered how Bitcoin as a legal tender affects cryptocurrency adoption in a given country. </p>\n<h2 id=\"where-is-the-crypto-adoption-curve-moving\">Where Is The Crypto Adoption Curve Moving?</h2>\n<p>Even with constraints in certain regions, many assume that we are moving towards a widespread cryptocurrency adoption on a global level. In recent <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5de588aa3e9c044c1ad8cb59/t/62a0cee064cb4b79ded25894/1654705890141/Bitcoin+User+Adoption+Report.pdf\">research</a> by Blockware Intelligence, it is predicted that 10% of the world’s population will use Bitcoin by 2030. Analysts investigated historical adoption curves of automobiles, electricity, internet and social media: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_86_61972fb256.png\" alt=\"crypto adoption curve\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5de588aa3e9c044c1ad8cb59/t/62a0cee064cb4b79ded25894/1654705890141/Bitcoin+User+Adoption+Report.pdf\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Then, researchers modeled a possible crypto adoption curve. It shows that Bitcoin in 2022 might be in the very early days of its global acceptance: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_87_43d7f26ee7.png\" alt=\"crypto adoption chart\" ></p>\n<p>Crypto adoption chart. <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5de588aa3e9c044c1ad8cb59/t/62a0cee064cb4b79ded25894/1654705890141/Bitcoin+User+Adoption+Report.pdf\">Image source</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"internet-vs-crypto-adoption\">Internet vs. crypto adoption</h3>\n<p>In the end of 2021, a popular crypto investor and educator Lark Davis posted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1471730881337323522\">tweet</a> with a crypto vs. internet adoption chart. It demonstrates how the number of internet and cryptocurrency users was growing at the times when technologies were (and still are, in the case of crypto) gaining traction. The correlation is striking: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_88_385dd2893a.png\" alt=\"internet vs crypto adoption\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/internet-vs-crypto-adoption-chart-predicts-1-billion-users-by-2027/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>These two datasets cannot predict the future for sure and tell us how exactly cryptocurrency gets adopted over the years. But what they do bring is new convincing evidence for a statement popular among crypto enthusiasts – global adoption of cryptocurrencies is a matter of when, not if. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-08-25T15:51:56.431Z","createdAt":"2022-08-25T14:45:18.482Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-25T15:52:54.847Z"},{"id":1257,"title":"Samsung Securities and 6 Other South Korean Brokers to Launch Crypto Exchanges in 2023","description":"Seven large domestic securities companies in South Korea have filed to open exchanges for Bitcoin and other digital assets in the first half of 2023.

One such project that is referred to as a canary development platform to Polkadot is called <strong><a href=\"https://kusama.network/\">Kusama</a></strong>. </p>\n<p>It’s often considered just a testnet or an experimental ecosystem. But the truth is that Kusama offers capabilities for new technological innovations. It can function as its own standalone network as long as the community is interested in building and maintaining it. Kusama envisions a social change where big institutions and entities will no longer have enormous power. </p>\n<p>The project has set out to disrupt the current social inequality in the world and take back control. We will have to see if they have the strength to do that. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/07_25_Kusama_review_01_0be1b35f8b.png\" alt=\"Kusama Coin Review 2022\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"about-kusama-ksm-coin\">About Kusama (KSM) Coin</h2>\n<p>Kusama was launched in 2019 and is a development network built with similar code as Polkadot. For this reason, it got the nickname Polkadot’s (wild) cousin. The project had a 3-days token sale that reached its hard cap and generated $2.5 million in revenue. This ecosystem gives no guarantees to developers and warns them to expect chaos. Risk and danger are on the agenda when working with Kusama.</p>\n<p>Polkadot has benefited dramatically from its younger cousin because many of its features were first tested and brought to perfection on Kusama. The network went live in October 2019 before Polkadot’s mainnet launch to test the performance under <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNSuvYaJ2Vg\">similar economic conditions</a>. </p>\n<p>The codebase of this untamed blockchain project is not audited. Hence, one of its use cases was to check for bugs and vulnerabilities in a live environment. Kusama is perfectly suited for fast code deployment. Some developers even chose to stay and not migrate to a different blockchain. </p>\n<p>The ecosystem has a publicly traded coin – <strong>KSM</strong>. It has a governance process, a DAO, staking capabilities, and much more. Moreover, interested parties can launch their own sharded blockchains called parachains with minimum requirements thanks to Kusama’s next-generation network technology.        </p>\n<h2 id=\"kusama-ksm-team\">Kusama (KSM) Team</h2>\n<p>Kusama’s creator is <strong>dr. Gavin Wood</strong>. This British computer scientist is also the co-founder of Ethereum and the founder of Polkadot. Two of his closest associates are <strong>Peter</strong> <strong>Czaban</strong> and <strong>Robert</strong> <strong>Habermeier</strong>. Unfortunately, other team members are not mentioned on the official website.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_8e68d1dee8.jpeg\" alt=\"kusama team\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web3.foundation/about/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p>Kusama is supported by the <strong><a href=\"https://web3.foundation/\">Web3 Foundation</a></strong>, an organization that funds decentralized and open-source projects as part of Web 3.0. This foundation was also created by <a href=\"https://web3.foundation/about/\">Dr. Gavin Wood</a><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">,</span> who is one of its directors. Gavin is a computer scientist and programming languages designer. He was essential in the creation of Ethereum’s smart-contract enabled platform Solidity. </p>\n<p>Besides him, the Foundation Council consists of <strong>Dr Aeron Buchanan</strong> and <strong>Reto Trinkler</strong>. Dr Buchanan is an ex-Ethereum scientist and mathematical modeler. He is an advisor to several important blockchain projects, has a doctoral degree in Robotics, and is proficient in engineering and computer science.  </p>\n<p>Reto is the founder of a blockchain platform and a software company. He is a mathematician and a professional smart contract developer.    </p>\n<h2 id=\"kusama-coin-ksm-roadmap\">Kusama Coin (KSM) Roadmap</h2>\n<p>The first version of the Kusama blockchain was launched in <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/kusama/profile/roadmap\">August 2019</a>. After one month of intensive testing, a software upgrade was released that fixed several key issues that were discovered. The initial chain used the <strong>Proof of Authority (POA)</strong> consensus algorithm. Still, in October 2019, the community prepared to move to <strong>Nominated Proof of Stake</strong>. At the beginning of January 2020, an unsuccessful chain upgrade bricked Kusama, causing some downtime. The developers needed 8 days to fix the network before it finally returned to a normal state on 12 January 2020.</p>\n<p>The launch of new features and upgrades on Kusama take place through <strong><a href=\"https://polkadot.network/launch-parachains/\">Parachain Rollouts</a></strong>. This process began in December 2021, giving the community a chance to vote on the future development of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The first step involves introducing new features on a Polkadot testnet like <strong>Rococo</strong>. Once the code is optimized and ready to go live, the community can vote on enabling a certain Parachain and onboard it to Kusama. This is done through <strong><a href=\"https://kusama.network/auctions/\">Parachain Slot Auctions</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The new features will be observed on a live blockchain allowing developers to take note of the network effects and make code optimizations if necessary. Then, if the Kusama community is satisfied with the results of the test phase, they can vote to integrate the features onto the blockchain.   </p>\n<p>The first Parachain Slot Auction started on 15 June 2021. Each proposal has a one-week bidding period before a new auction begins. The current timetable shows submitted community projects until January 2023, when the 67th auction is scheduled to take place. </p>\n<h2 id=\"kusama-coin-ksm-network\">Kusama Coin (KSM) Network</h2>\n<p>There are various ways to be part of this fast-moving network. </p>\n<p>Developers can utilize Kusama to create new features by releasing their own parachains, parathreads, and network bridges. </p>\n<p>Regular crypto enthusiasts can become <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/kusama-ksm/#The_Intended_Use_for_Kusama\">network maintainers</a>. Anyone with a stake in KSM can become a <strong>nominator</strong> and delegate their assets to a <strong>validator</strong>. Block rewards are then shared among the nominators, but they don’t depend on their total KSM stake.</p>\n<p>Block creators are called <strong>collators</strong>. Their job is to add transactions to future blocks and connect these blocks to the Kusama blockchain. Validators verify that the consensus rules are respected, and they secure the network. If a validator acts against the interests of Kusama, their rewards can be slashed.</p>\n<p>The last group of community members are responsible for the <strong>governance</strong>. Holders of KSM tokens vote on new features and code upgrades. Kusama is community-operated, where the stakeholders decide what route to take.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"kusama-parachains\">Kusama Parachains</h3>\n<p>The Kusama ecosystem is made up of <a href=\"https://kusama.network/parachains/\">interconnected parachains</a>. These have several advantages over traditional legacy networks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parachains can be custom-built for gaming, NFTs, DAOs, IoT, DeFi, and other use cases.</li>\n<li>The chains can connect to each other, allowing for a seamless flow of data and monetary value.</li>\n<li>Scalability is solved by parallel transaction processing across the entire network.</li>\n<li>Parachains can have their own treasuries, creating financial incentives for decentralized communities. </li>\n<li>Each separate chain can customize its own governance features best suited for its needs.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://substrate.io/\">Substrate blockchain framework</a> is supported for a simple and efficient development process.</li>\n<li>Parachains run with low and customizable fee rates.   </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-kusama-coin-ksm\">How to Mine Kusama Coin (KSM)?</h2>\n<p>Kusama uses a <strong>Nominated Proof of Stake</strong> consensus algorithm, making it unsuitable for mining, but KSM tokens can be staked. To participate in the staking process, you can either be a nominator or a validator. Either way, KSM tokens need to be locked as collateral. Block rewards are paid out <a href=\"https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-staking\">equally to all validators</a> regardless of their stake. </p>\n<p>Nominators delegate their assets to a validator they trust. Staking can be done through the <strong><a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/\">Polkadot JS</a></strong> wallet, where nominators can back up to 24 different validators. To have a chance to nominate, users are required to have a minimum of <strong>0.1 KSM</strong> in their wallets. <a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.dwellir.com#/staking\">The current list</a> consists of 1.000 different validators and around 8.000 nominators.</p>\n<p>Kusama has a slashing feature that penalizes validators for breaking the rules. That includes being offline, running non-standard software or code and trying to attack the network. If such events happen, both the validator and its nominators will have parts of their stake slashed.</p>\n<p>Deducted amounts are sent to the Kusama treasury from where they can re-enter circulation if approved by the Council. Various proposals are considered when deciding if treasury funds can be spent. These include improving the network&#39;s operations, increasing blockchain security, marketing and community events, software upgrades, etc.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"kusama-coin-ksm-2022-price-prediction\">Kusama Coin (KSM) 2022 Price Prediction</h2>\n<p>Kusama’s native KSM coin is trading at around $48 to $49 in mid-July 2022. Market analysts from <strong>Coin Price Forecast</strong> and <strong>PricePrediction</strong> have taken a closer look at this digital asset, and this is what they have to say about it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"coin-price-forecast\">Coin Price Forecast</h3>\n<p>The team from <a href=\"https://coinpriceforecast.com/kusama#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20latest%20long,within%20the%20year%20of%202024.\">Coin Price Forecast</a> have submitted their long-term analysis on Kusama.

It’s a virtual world suitable for many use cases, from DeFi to IoT and NFTs. Kusama is the place where many projects are born, evolve, and eventually move to its bigger brother, Polkadot. </p>\n<p>The network shares many similarities with Polkadot, including a very similar codebase. In addition, the two projects were created by the same person – a man who was essential to the success of Ethereum. But Kusama offers plenty of firepower that makes people want to stick around. It has much faster development, and the costs for creating and running a parachain are lower than on Polkadot. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2022-08-04T13:23:13.414Z","createdAt":"2022-08-04T12:52:19.704Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-04T13:23:13.427Z"},{"id":1234,"title":"US SEC Charges Forsage for an Alleged Pyramid Scheme","description":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged 11 individuals responsible for creating and promoting an alleged crypto Ponzi scheme.","slug":"us-sec-charges-forsage-for-an-alleged-pyramid-scheme","metaTitle":"US SEC Charges Forsage for an Alleged Pyramid Scheme","metaDescription":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged 11 individuals responsible for creating and promoting an alleged crypto Ponzi scheme.","featuredImage":{"id":5375,"name":"forsage pyramid scheme.png","alternativeText":"US SEC Charges Forsage for an Alleged Pyramid Scheme","caption":"","hash":"forsage_pyramid_scheme_3ec04001fb","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/forsage_pyramid_scheme_3ec04001fb.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_forsage_pyramid_scheme_3ec04001fb.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_forsage_pyramid_scheme_3ec04001fb.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_forsage_pyramid_scheme_3ec04001fb.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_forsage_pyramid_scheme_3ec04001fb.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Four Forsage founders and seven others involved in the marketing of the fraudulent project are facing scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The Forsage website allowed millions of retail investors to enter transactions on various blockchains such as Ethereum, Tron, and Binance.
