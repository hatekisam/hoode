    "articleBody": "<p>Skepticism still rocked the market this past week causing cryptocurrencies like Chain (XCN) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) to record massive losses. In fact, the top coins on the losers’ table made double-digit losses. This was opposite to what was seen in the gainers’ leaderboard. Only XDC Network (XDC) recorded profits in double digits, while the rest made percentages that were at or close to the zero mark. As a matter of fact, the global market lost $82 billion in total capitalization this week, before gaining $24B in the last 24 hours. At writing the total market cap sits at $849 billion. </p>\n<p>With Christmas approaching, crypto investors are anticipating a market upturn since this has been the trend in the last three years. However, this past week showed that they would have to still wrestle with the bears for some time before the market makes a move toward value. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> traded at $17,810 at the beginning of the week. But unlike the previous week where it accumulated value, the premier cryptocurrency lost some of its value to trade at $16,868 by the end of the week. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> followed a similar trajectory, dropping to $1,215 from $1,323.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_21_market_recap_01_63bb61a6ff.png\" alt=\"12.21 crypto market recap\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"top-gainers-xdc-leads-with-a-wide-margin\">Top Gainers: XDC Leads With A Wide Margin</h2>\n<h3 id=\"xdc-network-xdc\">XDC Network (XDC)</h3>\n<p>It may seem as though <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xdc\">XDC</a> is (still) reaping the dividends of its <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/xdc-liquidity-mining-campaign-led-by-hummingbot-is-a-best-move-for-bringing-larger-community-to-provide-liquidity/\">liquidity campaign</a> launched by Hummingbot. A few weeks ago, the DeFi market-making software platform led a 12-week liquidity mining campaign on behalf of XDC. The aim of the campaign was to “unify large communities to provide liquidity.”</p>\n<p>Three weeks into the campaign and XDC is gaining momentum. This past week saw it gaining over 23% as it journeyed from $0.023 and peaked at $0.028.</p>\n<h3 id=\"immutable-x-imx\">Immutable X (IMX)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/immutable-x\">IMX</a> which had a spot in the losers&#39; table the previous week experienced a plot twist in the last seven days. In a not-so-impressive run to gain 2.40%, the token moved from $0.44 at the start of the week and touched $0.47 before settling at $0.45.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fei-usd-fei\">Fei USD (FEI)</h3>\n<p>Since the collapse of UST, crypto investors have been skeptical about stablecoins, especially algorithmic stablecoins. So it&#39;s quite unexpected to see <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/fei\">FEI</a> on the gainers&#39; chart. Last week, the coin danced between $0.99 and $1.00, culminating in a value gain of 0.79%.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tron-trx\">Tron (TRX)</h3>\n<p>Tron&#39;s <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tron\">TRX</a> had positive news this past week. It&#39;s reported that with a TVL of $4.30 billion, the token surpassed Binance&#39;s BSC to become the cryptocurrency with the second-highest total value locked (TVL). </p>\n<p>However, TRX hasn&#39;t been able to respond strongly to this news. Spiking from $0.055 to $0.058 at the beginning of the week, it returned to its $0.055 base by the end of the week. With only a 0.30% gain, the token may shed more value soon as its red candles are slowly taking over the greens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pax-gold-paxg\">PAX Gold (PAXG)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/pax-gold\">PAXG</a> managed to creep into the gainers&#39; leaderboard with a gain of 0.02%. It opened the week at $1,804, then plunged to $1,776. However, in a show of resilience, the coin recovered and closed the week at $1,816.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-losers-xcn-and-fil-lead-the-trend-of-double-digit-losses\">Top Losers: XCN and FIL Lead the Trend of Double-Digit Losses</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chain-xcn\">Chain (XCN)</h3>\n<p>Unlike IMX which found its way out of the losers&#39; table this past week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xcn-chain\">XCN</a> was chained to the table and even occupied the number 1 spot.  The coin which had lost 11% the previous week, went on to lose 39.45% last week. It made a steep descent to $0.02046 from $0.034.</p>\n<h3 id=\"filecoin-fil\">Filecoin (FIL)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/filecoin\">FIL</a> faced intense selling pressure last week. It registered massive losses of up to 32.18% as it tanked from $4.36 to trade at $2.93.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust-wallet-token-twt\">Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</h3>\n<p>This past week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/twt\">TWT</a> was also hit by the distrust and loss of faith plaguing the market. The native token of Trust Wallet witnessed massive selloffs and shed 31.14% of its value. The token which traded at $2.29 at the beginning of the week, fell to $1.30 within three days, before trudging to $1.55.</p>\n<h3 id=\"near-protocol-near\">NEAR Protocol (NEAR)</h3>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/near\">NEAR</a> reached a <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/near-investors-could-be-skeptical-about-celebrating-this-milestone-because/\">milestone</a> of 250 million transactions. However, this feat didn&#39;t rule out that, given current market dynamics, NEAR&#39;s journey towards amassing value is quite far. The cryptocurrency lost over 23%—falling from $1.72 to $1.30.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-sandbox-sand\">The Sandbox (SAND)</h3>\n<p>The Sandbox had major headlines this past week. The Sandbox was OpenZeppelin’s first client as the latter <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/195351/openzeppelin-releases-metaverse-security-service-signs-up-the-sandbox-as-client\">launched</a> its metaverse security service. Also, The Sandbox entered a <a href=\"https://sandboxgame.medium.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-wunderman-thompson-to-develop-new-experiences-in-the-metaverse-fbac1b526e91?source=rss-22d1079b43b4------2\">partnership</a> with advertising company Wunderman Thompson to provide decentralized entertainment content to the latter&#39;s clients. Forbes also announced that it would <a href=\"https://medium.com/sandbox-game/forbes-partners-with-the-sandbox-and-enters-the-metaverse-with-an-interactive-multiplayer-614c2305468\">launch</a> its metaverse hub through The Sandbox.</p>\n<p>However, these headlines were not rock-solid enough to hold <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/the-sandbox\">SAND</a>&#39;s value. Last week saw the token’s value cave in as if it stood on quicksand. It lost 22.37%, plummeting to $0.44 from $0.57.</p>\n"

In fact, the top coins on the losers’ table made double-digit losses. This was opposite to what was seen in the gainers’ leaderboard. Only XDC Network (XDC) recorded profits in double digits, while the rest made percentages that were at or close to the zero mark. As a matter of fact, the global market lost $82 billion in total capitalization this week, before gaining $24B in the last 24 hours. At writing the total market cap sits at $849 billion. </p>
<p>With Christmas approaching, crypto investors are anticipating a market upturn since this has been the trend in the last three years. However, this past week showed that they would have to still wrestle with the bears for some time before the market makes a move toward value. <a href="../../currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> traded at $17,810 at the beginning of the week. But unlike the previous week where it accumulated value, the premier cryptocurrency lost some of its value to trade at $16,868 by the end of the week. <a href="../../currencies/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> followed a similar trajectory, dropping to $1,215 from $1,323.</p>
<p><img src="../../content-api-sub/uploads/12_21_market_recap_01_63bb61a6ff.png" alt="12.21 crypto market recap"></p>
<h2 id="top-gainers-xdc-leads-with-a-wide-margin">Top Gainers: XDC Leads With A Wide Margin</h2>
<h3 id="xdc-network-xdc">XDC Network (XDC)</h3>
<p>It may seem as though <a href="/">XDC</a> is (still) reaping the dividends of its liquidity campaign launched by Hummingbot. A few weeks ago, the DeFi market-making software platform led a 12-week liquidity mining campaign on behalf of XDC. The aim of the campaign was to “unify large communities to provide liquidity.”</p>
<p>Three weeks into the campaign and XDC is gaining momentum. This past week saw it gaining over 23% as it journeyed from $0.023 and peaked at $0.028.</p>
<h3 id="immutable-x-imx">Immutable X (IMX)</h3>
<p><a href="/">IMX</a> which had a spot in the losers&#39; table the previous week experienced a plot twist in the last seven days. In a not-so-impressive run to gain 2.40%, the token moved from $0.44 at the start of the week and touched $0.47 before settling at $0.45.</p>
<h3 id="fei-usd-fei">Fei USD (FEI)</h3>
<p>Since the collapse of UST, crypto investors have been skeptical about stablecoins, especially algorithmic stablecoins. So it&#39;s quite unexpected to see <a href="/">FEI</a> on the gainers&#39; chart. Last week, the coin danced between $0.99 and $1.00, culminating in a value gain of 0.79%.</p>
<h3 id="tron-trx">Tron (TRX)</h3>
<p>Tron&#39;s <a href="../../currencies/tron/">TRX</a> had positive news this past week. It&#39;s reported that with a TVL of $4.30 billion, the token surpassed Binance&#39;s BSC to become the cryptocurrency with the second-highest total value locked (TVL). </p>
<p>However, TRX hasn&#39;t been able to respond strongly to this news. Spiking from $0.055 to $0.058 at the beginning of the week, it returned to its $0.055 base by the end of the week. With only a 0.30% gain, the token may shed more value soon as its red candles are slowly taking over the greens.</p>
<h3 id="pax-gold-paxg">PAX Gold (PAXG)</h3>
<p><a href="/">PAXG</a> managed to creep into the gainers&#39; leaderboard with a gain of 0.02%. It opened the week at $1,804, then plunged to $1,776. However, in a show of resilience, the coin recovered and closed the week at $1,816.</p>
<h2 id="top-losers-xcn-and-fil-lead-the-trend-of-double-digit-losses">Top Losers: XCN and FIL Lead the Trend of Double-Digit Losses</h2>
<h3 id="chain-xcn">Chain (XCN)</h3>
<p>Unlike IMX which found its way out of the losers&#39; table this past week, <a href="/">XCN</a> was chained to the table and even occupied the number 1 spot. The coin which had lost 11% the previous week, went on to lose 39.45% last week. It made a steep descent to $0.02046 from $0.034.</p>
<h3 id="filecoin-fil">Filecoin (FIL)</h3>
<p><a href="/">FIL</a> faced intense selling pressure last week. It registered massive losses of up to 32.18% as it tanked from $4.36 to trade at $2.93.</p>
<h3 id="trust-wallet-token-twt">Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</h3>
<p>This past week, <a href="/">TWT</a> was also hit by the distrust and loss of faith plaguing the market. The native token of Trust Wallet witnessed massive selloffs and shed 31.14% of its value. The token which traded at $2.29 at the beginning of the week, fell to $1.30 within three days, before trudging to $1.55.</p>
<h3 id="near-protocol-near">NEAR Protocol (NEAR)</h3>
<p>Last week, <a href="/">NEAR</a> reached a milestone of 250 million transactions. However, this feat didn&#39;t rule out that, given current market dynamics, NEAR&#39;s journey towards amassing value is quite far. The cryptocurrency lost over 23%—falling from $1.72 to $1.30.</p>
<h3 id="the-sandbox-sand">The Sandbox (SAND)</h3>
<p>The Sandbox had major headlines this past week. The Sandbox was OpenZeppelin’s first client as the latter launched its metaverse security service. Also, The Sandbox entered a partnership with advertising company Wunderman Thompson to provide decentralized entertainment content to the latter&#39;s clients. Forbes also announced that it would launch its metaverse hub through The Sandbox.</p>
<p>However, these headlines were not rock-solid enough to hold <a href="/">SAND</a>&#39;s value. Last week saw the token’s value cave in as if it stood on quicksand. It lost 22.37%, plummeting to $0.44 from $0.57.</p>

In fact, the top coins on the losers’ table made double-digit losses. This was opposite to what was seen in the gainers’ leaderboard. Only XDC Network (XDC) recorded profits in double digits, while the rest made percentages that were at or close to the zero mark. As a matter of fact, the global market lost $82 billion in total capitalization this week, before gaining $24B in the last 24 hours. At writing the total market cap sits at $849 billion. </p>\\n<p>With Christmas approaching, crypto investors are anticipating a market upturn since this has been the trend in the last three years. However, this past week showed that they would have to still wrestle with the bears for some time before the market makes a move toward value. <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\\\">Bitcoin</a> traded at $17,810 at the beginning of the week. But unlike the previous week where it accumulated value, the premier cryptocurrency lost some of its value to trade at $16,868 by the end of the week. <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\\\">Ethereum</a> followed a similar trajectory, dropping to $1,215 from $1,323.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_21_market_recap_01_63bb61a6ff.png\\\" alt=\\\"12.21 crypto market recap\\\" ></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"top-gainers-xdc-leads-with-a-wide-margin\\\">Top Gainers: XDC Leads With A Wide Margin</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"xdc-network-xdc\\\">XDC Network (XDC)</h3>\\n<p>It may seem as though <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xdc\\\">XDC</a> is (still) reaping the dividends of its <a href=\\\"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/xdc-liquidity-mining-campaign-led-by-hummingbot-is-a-best-move-for-bringing-larger-community-to-provide-liquidity/\\\">liquidity campaign</a> launched by Hummingbot. A few weeks ago, the DeFi market-making software platform led a 12-week liquidity mining campaign on behalf of XDC. The aim of the campaign was to “unify large communities to provide liquidity.”</p>\\n<p>Three weeks into the campaign and XDC is gaining momentum. This past week saw it gaining over 23% as it journeyed from $0.023 and peaked at $0.028.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"immutable-x-imx\\\">Immutable X (IMX)</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/immutable-x\\\">IMX</a> which had a spot in the losers&#39; table the previous week experienced a plot twist in the last seven days. In a not-so-impressive run to gain 2.40%, the token moved from $0.44 at the start of the week and touched $0.47 before settling at $0.45.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"fei-usd-fei\\\">Fei USD (FEI)</h3>\\n<p>Since the collapse of UST, crypto investors have been skeptical about stablecoins, especially algorithmic stablecoins. So it&#39;s quite unexpected to see <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/fei\\\">FEI</a> on the gainers&#39; chart. Last week, the coin danced between $0.99 and $1.00, culminating in a value gain of 0.79%.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"tron-trx\\\">Tron (TRX)</h3>\\n<p>Tron&#39;s <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tron\\\">TRX</a> had positive news this past week. It&#39;s reported that with a TVL of $4.30 billion, the token surpassed Binance&#39;s BSC to become the cryptocurrency with the second-highest total value locked (TVL). </p>\\n<p>However, TRX hasn&#39;t been able to respond strongly to this news. Spiking from $0.055 to $0.058 at the beginning of the week, it returned to its $0.055 base by the end of the week. With only a 0.30% gain, the token may shed more value soon as its red candles are slowly taking over the greens.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"pax-gold-paxg\\\">PAX Gold (PAXG)</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/pax-gold\\\">PAXG</a> managed to creep into the gainers&#39; leaderboard with a gain of 0.02%. It opened the week at $1,804, then plunged to $1,776. However, in a show of resilience, the coin recovered and closed the week at $1,816.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"top-losers-xcn-and-fil-lead-the-trend-of-double-digit-losses\\\">Top Losers: XCN and FIL Lead the Trend of Double-Digit Losses</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"chain-xcn\\\">Chain (XCN)</h3>\\n<p>Unlike IMX which found its way out of the losers&#39; table this past week, <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xcn-chain\\\">XCN</a> was chained to the table and even occupied the number 1 spot.  The coin which had lost 11% the previous week, went on to lose 39.45% last week. It made a steep descent to $0.02046 from $0.034.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"filecoin-fil\\\">Filecoin (FIL)</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/filecoin\\\">FIL</a> faced intense selling pressure last week. It registered massive losses of up to 32.18% as it tanked from $4.36 to trade at $2.93.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"trust-wallet-token-twt\\\">Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</h3>\\n<p>This past week, <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/twt\\\">TWT</a> was also hit by the distrust and loss of faith plaguing the market. The native token of Trust Wallet witnessed massive selloffs and shed 31.14% of its value. The token which traded at $2.29 at the beginning of the week, fell to $1.30 within three days, before trudging to $1.55.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"near-protocol-near\\\">NEAR Protocol (NEAR)</h3>\\n<p>Last week, <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/near\\\">NEAR</a> reached a <a href=\\\"https://ambcrypto.com/near-investors-could-be-skeptical-about-celebrating-this-milestone-because/\\\">milestone</a> of 250 million transactions. However, this feat didn&#39;t rule out that, given current market dynamics, NEAR&#39;s journey towards amassing value is quite far. The cryptocurrency lost over 23%—falling from $1.72 to $1.30.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-sandbox-sand\\\">The Sandbox (SAND)</h3>\\n<p>The Sandbox had major headlines this past week. The Sandbox was OpenZeppelin’s first client as the latter <a href=\\\"https://www.theblock.co/post/195351/openzeppelin-releases-metaverse-security-service-signs-up-the-sandbox-as-client\\\">launched</a> its metaverse security service. Also, The Sandbox entered a <a href=\\\"https://sandboxgame.medium.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-wunderman-thompson-to-develop-new-experiences-in-the-metaverse-fbac1b526e91?source=rss-22d1079b43b4------2\\\">partnership</a> with advertising company Wunderman Thompson to provide decentralized entertainment content to the latter&#39;s clients. Forbes also announced that it would <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/sandbox-game/forbes-partners-with-the-sandbox-and-enters-the-metaverse-with-an-interactive-multiplayer-614c2305468\\\">launch</a> its metaverse hub through The Sandbox.</p>\\n<p>However, these headlines were not rock-solid enough to hold <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/the-sandbox\\\">SAND</a>&#39;s value. Last week saw the token’s value cave in as if it stood on quicksand. It lost 22.37%, plummeting to $0.44 from $0.57.</p>\\n\"","categoryName":"market"}</script><script id="page-data">var pageData = {"blogNavigation":[{"id":1,"name":"News","url":"/news","icon":{"id":2466,"name":"Group 4226.svg","alternativeText":"news.svg","caption":"","hash":"Group_4226_7e84fe170a","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4226_7e84fe170a.svg"}},{"id":2,"name":"Market","url":"/market","icon":{"id":2467,"name":"market.svg","alternativeText":"market.svg","caption":"","hash":"market_bac2e5f4ca","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/market_bac2e5f4ca.svg"}},{"id":3,"name":"Academy","url":"/academy","icon":{"id":2468,"name":"academy.svg","alternativeText":"academy.svg","caption":"","hash":"academy_4fd1287353","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/academy_4fd1287353.svg"}},{"id":4,"name":"Industry","url":"/industry","icon":{"id":2469,"name":"industry.svg","alternativeText":"industry.svg","caption":"","hash":"industry_314a1d18b2","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/industry_314a1d18b2.svg"}},{"id":5,"name":"Tech","url":"/tech","icon":{"id":2470,"name":"tech.svg","alternativeText":"tech.svg","caption":"","hash":"tech_742cce0c5f","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/tech_742cce0c5f.svg"}},{"id":6,"name":"Coins","url":"/coin","icon":{"id":2471,"name":"coins.svg","alternativeText":"coins.svg","caption":"","hash":"coins_66c249d0f3","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/coins_66c249d0f3.svg"}},{"id":8,"name":"ChangeNOW","url":"/changenow","icon":{"id":2559,"name":"cn menu.svg","alternativeText":"cn menu.svg","caption":"","hash":"cn_menu_907fd042ad","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/cn_menu_907fd042ad.svg"}},{"id":7,"name":"Coffee break","url":"/coffee-break","icon":{"id":2472,"name":"coffee.svg","alternativeText":"coffee.svg","caption":"","hash":"coffee_16b1d0fb0d","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/coffee_16b1d0fb0d.svg"}}],"blogTopStories":[{"id":1374,"title":"What is Solana (SOL)? | Everything You Need to Know About Solana in 2023","description":"From the project's launch to major developments and latest prices - everything you need to know about Solana.","slug":"what-is-solana-sol","metaTitle":"What is Solana (SOL)? | Solana Price in 2023","metaDescription":"From Solana's launch to major developments and latest prices - everything you need to know about SOL in 2023.

Even as a newbie in the blockchain space, chances are you’ve heard about the Solana ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The network touts itself as the most performant permissionless blockchain globally, but with the crypto industry’s growth, it can be hard to keep up with all the new developments. Let’s explore Solana’s ins and outs and its evolution from its inception in 2017 up to 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-solana\">What is Solana?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-solana-blockchain\">Introducing the Solana Blockchain</h3>\n<p><strong>Solana</strong> is a blockchain platform that is designed to host decentralized and scalable applications. It is an open-source network, which means that developers can build and launch their own decentralized applications using it. Solana initially emerged as a rival to the Ethereum (<a href=\"link\">ETH</a>) blockchain. Like the latter, it offers smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s other core features include its high speed, with the potential to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, and low transaction costs averaging at $0.00025. Transaction fees on Solana are in the network’s native token, <a href=\"link\">SOL</a>.</p>\n<p>The Solana coin is a utility token that functions as a medium of exchange and helps prop up security on the platform via staking. The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former executive at Qualcomm, in 2017 and is currently run by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-solana\">A brief history of Solana</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-and-why-solana-was-created\">How and why Solana was created</h3>\n<p>Solana emerged in response to the scalability limitations of existing blockchain platforms such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BTC</a>) and Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Bitcoin price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believed that agreement on time was one of the biggest challenges of a distributed model.</p>\n<p>Yakovenko recognized that a reliable and accurate clock was crucial for network synchronization. As such, he began working on and developed the concept of <a href=\"link\">proof of history</a>. This technique allows for keeping time between untrusted computers, making network synchronization simpler and faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-exactly-is-solanas-proof-of-history\">What exactly is Solana’s proof of history?</h3>\n<p>The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism is Solana’s chosen technique to keep the time between computers that do not trust each other. The basic idea behind PoH is to use a &quot;timestamp&quot; that is generated by a central server and broadcast to all nodes on the network. This timestamp serves as a reference point for the network, allowing all nodes to agree on the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_26_18_PM_b5d4d80061.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.26.18 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"link\">Medium</a> </p>\n<p>To generate the timestamp, the central server creates a &quot;hash&quot; of a large amount of data (known as a &quot;PoH generator&quot;) and publishes it to the network. Each node on the network can then use this hash to verify the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p>The PoH generator is designed to be computationally expensive to create, ensuring it can only be generated by a central server and not by any individual node on the network. This helps to prevent any one node from manipulating the timestamp or the sequence of events.</p>\n<p>By using the PoH mechanism, Solana can achieve high levels of network synchronization and scalability, allowing it to process a large number of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement over other blockchain systems that lack a reliable clock and struggle to scale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-journey-to-the-solana-launch-yakovenkos-path\">The journey to the Solana launch: Yakovenko’s path</h3>\n<p>Solana was technically created in November 2017 when Anatoly Yakovenko published the whitepaper for the proof-of-history concept. This technique would serve as the foundation for the Solana project. With plans to weave all the world&#39;s transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called it Loom.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald <a href=\"link\">published</a> the first open-source implementation of the PoH technique on GitHub under the name Silk. The project quickly gained traction, and the team continued to develop it.</p>\n<p>By March 2018, the team rebranded the project as Solana, a nod to the small beach town where Yakovenko and his team lived and worked. In June of that same year, they had scaled the technology to run on cloud-based networks. The next month, they published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>After months of testing and development, the Solana mainnet went live on March 31, 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-price-evolution\">Solana price evolution</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-is-solana-worth\">How much is Solana worth?</h3>\n<p>Solana’s SOL token, like most cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price fluctuations. In the first few months after the launch, the Solana price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1.00.</p>\n<p>However, in late 2020, the price of Solana began to rise rapidly. Driven by the non-fungible token (NFT) hype and the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. SOL more than tripled to a peak of $18.00 in early 2021. Solana reached its all-time high of $258 in November 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_40_45_PM_ff2553a118.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.40.45 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Solana price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these gains were nearly wiped out by the end of last year due to the crypto crash and subsequent contagion. Solana’s price took a hard hit from FTX’s implosion due to its close association with the exchange and subsidiaries. SOL dropped under $10 in late December for the first time since February 2021. However, it has recovered in the past month to trade at $24.22 currently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-solana-coins-are-there\">How many Solana coins are there?</h3>\n<p>The Solana foundation revealed that the total number of Solana (SOL) coins to enter circulation is 489 million. At the moment, 260 million tokens are available on the market. </p>\n<h3 id=\"where-can-you-buy-solana\">Where can you buy Solana?</h3>\n<p>Solana (SOL) can be purchased on a variety of exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and <a href=\"link\">ChangeNow</a>. With a user-friendly interface and a wide variety of payment options, ChangeNow makes it easy for anyone to purchase SOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanas-major-developments\">Solana’s major developments</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2019\">Solana’s 2019</h3>\n<p>Right before the Solana mainnet launch, much of the team’s attention was on obtaining funding to develop its new crypto network. The project had already begun to gain traction.</p>\n<p>As such, the team was able to raise $20 million in a private token sale led by Multicoin Capital in Q1 2019. Other participants were Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2020\">Solana’s 2020</h3>\n<p>The year 2020 marked Solana’s emergence as the first blockchain to use proof of history. The platform launched on Mainnet Beta in March 2020, following successful fundraising and the launch of their public test network, Tour de SOL.</p>\n<p>That same year, <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href=\"link\">USDT</a>) launched Solana-native <strong>USDT</strong> and Circle partnered to make <strong><a href=\"link\">USDC</a></strong> a native stablecoin on the platform. Solana also held its first hackathon from October 28 to November 14.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Tether price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2021\">Solana’s 2021</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s 2020 hackathon and subsequent ones were a success, leading to an influx of developers and projects onto the platform. By December 2021, Solana had exceeded 1,000 projects and saw a significant rise in its price and daily active users. This propelled the SOL token to the fifth spot on the crypto list, surpassing <strong>Cardano</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<p>However, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for 17 hours. The platform had formerly gone down for 6 hours in December 2021, earning it a reputation for frequent outages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Cardano price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2022\">Solana’s 2022</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s outage problem persisted into 2022. Despite this, the network was able to make some progress. Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, announced integration with Ethereum and Polygon. In June, Solana revealed plans for the first crypto smartphone, the Solana Saga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/solana_saga_01_7aaaabbbc6.jpg\" alt=\"solana-saga_01.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>The platform also opened a physical store in New York City dedicated to all things crypto in July. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Solana_just_launched_a_physical_store_in_metaverse_79dcec4278.jpg\" alt=\"Solana-just-launched-a-physical-store-in-metaverse.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>Notably, Solana&#39;s NFT market experienced substantial growth in 2022, with the number of minted NFTs reaching 312,000 on September 7. Additionally, Solana NFT trading volumes rose to hit $11.5 million on September 6.</p>\n<p>However, in August, the platform&#39;s mobile wallet suffered a hack resulting in $8 million worth of losses. Thousands of Solana users suffered in the attack, which Solana ultimately blamed on a third-party platform, the Slope mobile wallet app. Solana experienced more losses later on as the FTX and Alameda saga caused the single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics as SOL dipped 96%. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solana-ecosystem\">The Solana ecosystem</h3>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem is home to a diverse range of projects, from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The platform’s speed, affordability, and scalability mean it is quickly becoming a go-to destination for developers, entrepreneurs, and users who want to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications and services. </p>\n<p>Among these projects are <strong>Phantom</strong>, a decentralized social network that empowers users to share content, earn rewards, and connect with others; <strong>Stepn</strong> (<a href=\"link\">GMT</a>), a platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows artists and creators to monetize their work. Solana also hosts <strong>Star Atlas</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ATLAS</a>), a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading digital assets, and <strong>Audius</strong>, initially built on Ethereum but moved to Solana in 2020, a decentralized streaming platform for musicians that enables them to control their music and earn royalties directly from fans.</p>\n<p>More recently, <strong>BONK</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BONK</a>),  “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people,” which was released in December 2020. </p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Like most other projects in the crypto industry, Solana reaped the benefits of 2021’s DeFi and NFT boom. In the same vein, it was unable to escape the impact of the crypto winter in 2022. Still, its attractive blend of speed and affordability, thanks to its unique technology, makes it a staple for most developers in this space. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest SOL trading pairs <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-26T19:28:00.275Z","createdAt":"2023-01-26T18:47:45.949Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-27T13:56:35.789Z"},{"id":1366,"title":"ChangeNOW stands against fraudulent actions amid Alameda wallets' suspicious activity","description":"Taking into account the company's high AML standards in terms of resistance to illegal activity, ChangeNOW is putting serious effort into preventing such incidents as the recent Alameda wallets’ case.","slug":"changenow-stands-against-fraudulent-actions-ensures-high-compliance-standards-amid-alameda-wallets-suspicious-activity","metaTitle":"ChangeNOW position amid Alameda suspicious activity","metaDescription":"The compliance team works round-the-clock with investigation inquiries related to Alameda funds movement","featuredImage":{"id":6782,"name":"12.28 Alameda Incident Statement-01.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Once fraudulent activity was first reported by investigators, the ChangeNOW compliance team responded immediately and blocklisted suspicious wallets.

It will include 1,000 NFTs in the “Proof-of-Collection” style, which means those who own the collection would receive exclusive and privileged “types of experiences and possibilities, exploring the full potential of the physical and digital worlds.”\n<em>“The evolution of the cryptocurrency and NFT market has shown that NFTs that do not have a community proposal quickly lose their value as they are not based on real benefits but only on FUD and speculation. Furthermore, offering APYs with extreme profitability, as happened with UST/LUNA, turned out to be a failed proposition that only makes users lose their money,“</em> the rapper said.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/06_03_crypto_opinion_French_Montana_1_01_808638c28a.png\" alt=\"Exclusive: French Montana Unveils Plans to Revolutionize Music &amp; Crypto with Web3, NFTs, and Metaverse\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-new-era-of-nfts\">The New Era of NFTs</h2>\n<p><em>“The market experience has shown that projects based on memes and “Come Get Rich” promotions are nothing more than projects whose future is uncertain and often end up harming investors. By putting technology first, these projects have become highly reliant on royalties and hype to become a successful business. These events show us that success lies in focusing on projects that combine technology and real use cases,“</em> the artist explained.\nAccording to French Montana, the true value of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is not that they are an immutable digital representation of audiovisual items. <em>“It’s not just animated gifs and jpgs that are hashed on the blockchain, or items intended for speculation and FUD. The true value of NFTs lies in building a new digital identity and a new way of connecting communities through physical and digital experiences on a Web3.0 chain.“</em>\nMontana said that prior to the pandemic he had heard about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but never paid much attention to them. The pandemic, however, brought worldwide attention to the subject, which prompted him to read and seek to understand more about it.\nIt was then that he concluded it wasn’t just about digital currencies, but also about a new form of ‘contract’ that could give artists and the community back their data and ownership rights.\n<em>“When I started out, DVDs were the only game in town. Soon, YouTube became a huge deal. After that, the same happened with Instagram and TikTok. Now NFTs will be the next wave of technology to change the way music is produced and distributed and I want to be at the forefront of that with the French Family NFT,“</em> the rapper said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"french-family-membership--social-network\">French Family Membership + Social Network</h2>\n<p>French Montana said that he owns 100% of the production and distribution rights to his new album Montega, and Web3 is precisely about people being able to choose how their data is used. People want to own their preferences in Web3, such as their favorite songs, their artists, their avatars, etc.\n<em>“I want to own everything I produce and with NFTs I can share ownership of my production with my fans, with the French Family, who are the people who really make me grow as an artist, who come to my shows and who encourage and support me to continue doing my work”,</em> French said at the opening of the Miami NFT week.\nNow the artist revealed to Mike that French Family Membership will be your identity within the French Montana digital family. Therefore, as part of this family, each French Family Membership holder can get free access to all the events by French Montana or by some of French Montana’s friends in the USM Metaverse and the NFT marketplace.\nEach holder can release a virtual fashion brand cross-over with French Montana. The virtual brands are only for 3D avatars or for wearables on 3D avatars in the United States of Mars, USM. The design (Logo, images, words, pictures, videos) of virtual fashion brands’ should be voted by FM holders. More details will be announced by the French Family.\nIn addition, there will be more perks for French Family Membership holders linked to French Montana and some French Montana friends in USM, like the exclusive and unique collection DRWT PFP (under construction). More applications and projects are already being designed by the teams and will be announced exclusively for French Family Membership holders.\n<em>“This is our concept of building a community around French Family Membership. We are not talking about price speculation based on fomo, fud, attention, and influencers here. We are building a new decentralized digital community that expands individual possibilities while creating benefits for the entire community together,“</em> he said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"french-family-membership--copyright\">French Family Membership + Copyright</h2>\n<p>French revealed that each owner of the French Family Membership collection will also have rights attached to Montana’s new album “Montega”. The artist’s new production will be a connected music album with unique digital and physical experiences that will be unlocked through a collection of NFTs called “French Montana’s Music Album NFT” (MTG).\nFor this collection, three categories of MTG NFTs will be produced: Super Rare, Rare, and Normal, each with different benefits. And each member of the French Family will receive, via airdrop, super rare NFTs, which will unlock other exclusive benefits such as the digital version of the new Montega album, backstage access to French Montana concerts until 2025, and commercial and sales rights to the Montega album.\nTherefore, the holders of French Family Membership will also be lifetime copyright and commercial owners of the Montega album. It means that all the money that French Montana earns from the distribution and exhibition of the new album will be shared with the French Family Membership holders who will be entitled to receive a Super Rare NFT MTG.</p>\n<h2 id=\"french-family-membership--ethereum-layer-2-blockchain\">French Family Membership + Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchain</h2>\n<p><em>“We are creating a truly open and community-driven ecosystem for the French Family. This is not just an NFT project. We are talking about a real revolution in the cryptocurrency industry. The holders of a French Family NFT will truly be part of the French Montana family and, in doing so, will share with the star the benefits of everything we are creating, owning an NFT French Family Membership is not just a matter of commercial rights linked to the Montega album. There is so much more,“</em> revealed Jeff Watney, the visionary of French Family Membership NFT.\nFrench Family Membership also means being part of JAZ, the layer 2 blockchain linked to the collection, much like Solana or Polygon. This will eliminate problems similar to those that BAYC faced in the launch of Otherside, such as high gas fees.\nFurthermore, the new layer 2 blockchain will be born as the native network for the French Family Membership NFT and for all other projects that are already being built on the network. The blockchain will also have a development package that will allow the creation of dApps, play-to-earn games, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and NFT projects, among others. All this has been linked to exclusive and unique benefits for holders of the French Family Membership NFT collection.\nFrench Family NFT holders will benefit from nodes of the new network and, in addition to being validators of the new layer 2 solution, will receive rewards for transactions related to all JAZ-based projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"were-going-to-change-the-game\">‘We’re Going to Change the Game’</h2>\n<p>JAZ will be a decentralized and open blockchain solution for the entire community, comparable to what Solidity is to Ethereum. Developers will be able to create various blockchain-based applications through the JAZ development package. One of the projects that is already being built on JAZ involves a major Web3.0 project that will have an impact on the music industry and is already attracting attention from big names in the music ecosystem behind the scenes.\n<em>“Web3 gives musicians more control over their art and creation. Most artists only get 12% of what labels make. With 100% control over how my music is distributed, my community can grow. If I’m not mistaken the music industry makes $13m an hour with music and web 3 is definitely a revolution for artists to start gaining more capital,“</em> French Montana said.\nIn Montana’s opinion, the combination of NFTs, Web3 , and the metaverse could be an important tool to eliminate prejudice and allow people to live up to their full potential.\n<em>“Web3 is a powerful tool to build equality against the real world while there is no even. Early builders, creators and contributors will have more power and this more power is more possibilities for creating a better world. We are definitely going to change the game,“</em> he said.</p>\n<p><em>Mike Ermolaev, the Head of Public Relations at <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW.io</a>, conducts exclusive interviews with prominent crypto experts for Benzinga to provide beginners and seasoned crypto investors alike with valuable insight into the world of crypto.

Its main features include professional charting tools for financial markets and a graphical interface that makes it possible to track and predict market trends. Lastly, it’s used for the analysis of profitable investment opportunities. </p>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market has found its own user base on <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/\">TradingView</a>. With a little bit of training, you can learn how to analyze crypto charts to make better financial decisions concerning your investments. The cryptocurrency markets aren’t that different from traditional financial markets, but they have their own characteristics and peculiarities.     </p>\n<p>Let’s now see how to analyze a TradingView chart and understand what it shows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-what-candlesticks-and-candlestick-charts-are\">Understanding What Candlesticks and Candlestick Charts Are</h2>\n<p><strong>Candlesticks</strong> show the price of a particular asset in a specific period. So by looking at a candle, we can see a few different things. </p>\n<p>Take a look at this <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/cDwWYDni/\">Bitcoin/USDT chart from TradingView</a> to understand what information a single candlestick entails.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_24a24a038d.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>A candle is made up of a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>wick</strong>. The body is the wide part of the image, and the narrow lines you see above and under it are called wicks. The size of the body depends on the price movement in that time period. For example, suppose these candles are for the 1-hour chart. In that case, the body shows how much the price fluctuated during that hour.</p>\n<p>Candlesticks can be <strong>green</strong> or <strong>red</strong>. A green candle on a 1-hour chart shows that the price closed above the value it opened at after one hour. Opposite to that, a red candle shows that the closing value has depreciated compared to the valuation at the start of that period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-how-do-we-know-where-the-price-opened-and-where-it-closed\">But how do we know where the price opened and where it closed?</h3>\n<p>Look at the body of the green candle above. The bottom line of its body was the asset&#39;s price when that time period started. The top of the body represents the value when the timeframe ended. The wicks show the highest and lowest value the price moved to during that period. The wick on top is obviously the high, while the one at the bottom is the low.</p>\n<p>A red candle is an exact opposite. The top of this candle’s body is the opening price, while the bottom is the closing one. The wick lines are the same as with the bullish green candlestick.</p>\n<p>When we group these candles together, we get a <strong>candlestick chart</strong> that looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed2_aabbd8489a.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed2.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"recognizing-trends-and-market-movements-based-on-candlesticks\">Recognizing Trends and Market Movements Based on Candlesticks</h2>\n<p>Now that we know what candlesticks are, we can look at TradingView charts and try to predict <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynxyoKgpng\">trending markets</a></strong>. Knowing whether we are in an <strong>upward</strong> or <strong>downward</strong> trend makes it easier to predict what happens next and when and where to place our buy and sell orders. Making trading decisions based on a current trend is a popular strategy because it’s easier than predicting when a bear or bull market is likely to start.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uptrend-markets\">Uptrend Markets</h3>\n<p>When the market is in an uptrend, you will notice that the candles create the following movements: new highs, followed by higher lows, new higher highs, new higher lows, etc., in regular intervals. </p>\n<p>Here is an excellent example of how that looks on a candlestick chart:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_8ca27c835e.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>But not all graphs are that simple, and sometimes it is difficult to recognize the patterns of a trending market. Therefore, there are some other indicators you should pay attention to.</p>\n<p>One interesting thing we can watch out for in trending markets are so-called <strong>impulsive moves</strong>. Whenever a price change leads to reaching a new high, we call that an <strong>impulsive move</strong>. After such an event, we often see a <strong>pullback</strong>. A pullback in an uptrend is when the value drops down from its peak for a brief period.</p>\n<p>To check whether the market is still trending upwards, we need to look at the charts and check the lowest closing price of the previous pullback. The value can’t close below that price for the market to still be considered an uptrend. When we see an impulsive move followed by a new high, the subsequent price action will be a pullback. The latest lowest point of that pullback must be above the line of the previous one. If it isn’t and closes below it, we may be witnessing a <strong>reversal</strong> and an end of the uptrend movement. </p>\n<p>This is how it looks on our previous graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_19215e9c9e.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h3 id=\"downtrend-markets\">Downtrend Markets</h3>\n<p>Using the opposite rules that we applied to upward movements, a downward market is recognized by lower lows and lower highs than what we witnessed previously. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_62fab9b0f8.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>We will use the same logic with impulsive moves and pullbacks to determine whether we are still in a downward trending market. However, a pullback will cause a slight rise in the asset’s value in this scenario.</p>\n<p>When we have an impulsive move followed by a pullback, the market can’t close above the highest point of the previous pullback. As long as it stays below, we are still in a downtrend market. </p>\n<p>Here we can see that represented on the graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_cb80af26fd.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"support--resistance-what-is-it-and-how-to-take-advantage-of-it\">Support & Resistance: What Is It and How to Take Advantage of It?</h2>\n<p>Support and resistance are zones where a traded asset finds a type of barrier that prevents it from further growth or decline. For example, if Bitcoin’s value drops, <strong>support</strong> will act as a safe zone to stop further price depreciation. Why? Because traders have submitted enough buy orders at that level to purchase the asset at a discount. Opposite of that, we have <strong>resistance</strong>. This tool acts as another barrier that stops the further rise of a listed asset. </p>\n<p>Support and resistance can be used to identify 3 things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possible reversals</li>\n<li>Entry points into a trending market</li>\n<li>Stop-loss and target zones in trending markets</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"identify-entry-points-based-on-support-and-resistance\">Identify Entry Points Based on Support and Resistance</h3>\n<p>If we suppose that an upward trending market will continue, we can find a previous high point (which acted as resistance) that was later broken during an impulsive move. That high now becomes support after a market pullback. If the price drops to that area and rebounds back up, the zone can be considered support. </p>\n<p>Let’s look at a simple chart showing this concept on an upward market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2b0ecb21ae.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>We apply the opposite approach in a downtrend market if we expect the bearish trend to continue. We are looking for a low point that acted as support just before a pullback to find these zones. After the price rebounded back up from the support zone, the downtrend continued, the previous low point was broken, and a new low was set. We then witness a second pullback after an impulsive move. The price shoots back up to the zone that acted as a support. However, this area has now become resistance causing the market to reverse and continue the downtrend.  </p>\n<p>This is how it looks like on a TradingView graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_7fb0dd5c6f.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>Identifying these areas of interest makes it easier to set buy or sell orders in a trending market. That&#39;s because we now have a good idea of how the price action will continue.</p>\n<p>Suppose you have successfully recognized support and resistance in an upward market. In that case, you know the area beyond which the price will not fall. You can set your buy order in this support zone with a stop-loss slightly under it just in case the price drops further before it rebounds. By now, you have learned that in a bullish (uptrend) market, the lowest point of the pullback can’t close below the low point of the previous pullback. If that is still the case, the current trend will likely continue, and a new high will be broken. If you are a trader, your target zone where you take profits could be in the area of the previous high.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_9a7f67525f.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>TradingView is the most popular charting tool in the world. Candlesticks are the main components of any professional graph. Based on the candle movements and patterns, it’s possible to determine what direction a market is taking. The two most common scenarios are upward and downward trends.</p>\n<p>By identifying zones in a trending market that act as support and resistance, we will understand what to expect next and apply our trading strategy. If the goal is to trade profitably, we can use this knowledge to set a realistic target zone where we intend to sell and a stop-loss limit to protect us from significant upsets.    </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-04-15T09:40:41.777Z","createdAt":"2022-04-15T09:40:40.751Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-20T11:58:48.803Z"},{"id":1122,"title":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet","description":"Users can now export private keys with the new version of NOW Wallet.","slug":"private-keys-export-feature-added-to-now-wallet","metaTitle":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet ","metaDescription":"Users can now export private keys with the new version of NOW Wallet.","featuredImage":{"id":4573,"name":"Private keys export-02.png","alternativeText":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet ","caption":"","hash":"Private_keys_export_01_123981538f","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Signing transactions and proving ownership of blockchain addresses require private keys.

In fact, the top coins on the losers’ table made double-digit losses. This was opposite to what was seen in the gainers’ leaderboard. Only XDC Network (XDC) recorded profits in double digits, while the rest made percentages that were at or close to the zero mark. As a matter of fact, the global market lost $82 billion in total capitalization this week, before gaining $24B in the last 24 hours. At writing the total market cap sits at $849 billion. </p>\n<p>With Christmas approaching, crypto investors are anticipating a market upturn since this has been the trend in the last three years. However, this past week showed that they would have to still wrestle with the bears for some time before the market makes a move toward value. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> traded at $17,810 at the beginning of the week. But unlike the previous week where it accumulated value, the premier cryptocurrency lost some of its value to trade at $16,868 by the end of the week. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> followed a similar trajectory, dropping to $1,215 from $1,323.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_21_market_recap_01_63bb61a6ff.png\" alt=\"12.21 crypto market recap\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"top-gainers-xdc-leads-with-a-wide-margin\">Top Gainers: XDC Leads With A Wide Margin</h2>\n<h3 id=\"xdc-network-xdc\">XDC Network (XDC)</h3>\n<p>It may seem as though <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xdc\">XDC</a> is (still) reaping the dividends of its <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/xdc-liquidity-mining-campaign-led-by-hummingbot-is-a-best-move-for-bringing-larger-community-to-provide-liquidity/\">liquidity campaign</a> launched by Hummingbot. A few weeks ago, the DeFi market-making software platform led a 12-week liquidity mining campaign on behalf of XDC. The aim of the campaign was to “unify large communities to provide liquidity.”</p>\n<p>Three weeks into the campaign and XDC is gaining momentum. This past week saw it gaining over 23% as it journeyed from $0.023 and peaked at $0.028.</p>\n<h3 id=\"immutable-x-imx\">Immutable X (IMX)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/immutable-x\">IMX</a> which had a spot in the losers&#39; table the previous week experienced a plot twist in the last seven days. In a not-so-impressive run to gain 2.40%, the token moved from $0.44 at the start of the week and touched $0.47 before settling at $0.45.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fei-usd-fei\">Fei USD (FEI)</h3>\n<p>Since the collapse of UST, crypto investors have been skeptical about stablecoins, especially algorithmic stablecoins. So it&#39;s quite unexpected to see <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/fei\">FEI</a> on the gainers&#39; chart. Last week, the coin danced between $0.99 and $1.00, culminating in a value gain of 0.79%.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tron-trx\">Tron (TRX)</h3>\n<p>Tron&#39;s <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tron\">TRX</a> had positive news this past week. It&#39;s reported that with a TVL of $4.30 billion, the token surpassed Binance&#39;s BSC to become the cryptocurrency with the second-highest total value locked (TVL). </p>\n<p>However, TRX hasn&#39;t been able to respond strongly to this news. Spiking from $0.055 to $0.058 at the beginning of the week, it returned to its $0.055 base by the end of the week. With only a 0.30% gain, the token may shed more value soon as its red candles are slowly taking over the greens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pax-gold-paxg\">PAX Gold (PAXG)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/pax-gold\">PAXG</a> managed to creep into the gainers&#39; leaderboard with a gain of 0.02%. It opened the week at $1,804, then plunged to $1,776. However, in a show of resilience, the coin recovered and closed the week at $1,816.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-losers-xcn-and-fil-lead-the-trend-of-double-digit-losses\">Top Losers: XCN and FIL Lead the Trend of Double-Digit Losses</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chain-xcn\">Chain (XCN)</h3>\n<p>Unlike IMX which found its way out of the losers&#39; table this past week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/xcn-chain\">XCN</a> was chained to the table and even occupied the number 1 spot.  The coin which had lost 11% the previous week, went on to lose 39.45% last week. It made a steep descent to $0.02046 from $0.034.</p>\n<h3 id=\"filecoin-fil\">Filecoin (FIL)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/filecoin\">FIL</a> faced intense selling pressure last week. It registered massive losses of up to 32.18% as it tanked from $4.36 to trade at $2.93.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust-wallet-token-twt\">Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</h3>\n<p>This past week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/twt\">TWT</a> was also hit by the distrust and loss of faith plaguing the market. The native token of Trust Wallet witnessed massive selloffs and shed 31.14% of its value. The token which traded at $2.29 at the beginning of the week, fell to $1.30 within three days, before trudging to $1.55.</p>\n<h3 id=\"near-protocol-near\">NEAR Protocol (NEAR)</h3>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/near\">NEAR</a> reached a <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/near-investors-could-be-skeptical-about-celebrating-this-milestone-because/\">milestone</a> of 250 million transactions. However, this feat didn&#39;t rule out that, given current market dynamics, NEAR&#39;s journey towards amassing value is quite far. The cryptocurrency lost over 23%—falling from $1.72 to $1.30.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-sandbox-sand\">The Sandbox (SAND)</h3>\n<p>The Sandbox had major headlines this past week. The Sandbox was OpenZeppelin’s first client as the latter <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/195351/openzeppelin-releases-metaverse-security-service-signs-up-the-sandbox-as-client\">launched</a> its metaverse security service. Also, The Sandbox entered a <a href=\"https://sandboxgame.medium.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-wunderman-thompson-to-develop-new-experiences-in-the-metaverse-fbac1b526e91?source=rss-22d1079b43b4------2\">partnership</a> with advertising company Wunderman Thompson to provide decentralized entertainment content to the latter&#39;s clients. Forbes also announced that it would <a href=\"https://medium.com/sandbox-game/forbes-partners-with-the-sandbox-and-enters-the-metaverse-with-an-interactive-multiplayer-614c2305468\">launch</a> its metaverse hub through The Sandbox.</p>\n<p>However, these headlines were not rock-solid enough to hold <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/the-sandbox\">SAND</a>&#39;s value. Last week saw the token’s value cave in as if it stood on quicksand. It lost 22.37%, plummeting to $0.44 from $0.57.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-12-21T14:26:27.740Z","createdAt":"2022-12-21T14:26:24.203Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-21T14:26:27.765Z"},"blogFullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/market-wrap-a-positive-twist-for-xdc-xcn-sticks-to-losing"}</script><script src="../../dist/runtime.2c181f20261ceafc0d09.js" defer></script><script src="../../dist/blog-page.d8ea7f26d45790df758a.js" defer></script></body></html>
