Even as a newbie in the blockchain space, chances are you’ve heard about the Solana ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The network touts itself as the most performant permissionless blockchain globally, but with the crypto industry’s growth, it can be hard to keep up with all the new developments. Let’s explore Solana’s ins and outs and its evolution from its inception in 2017 up to 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-solana\">What is Solana?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-solana-blockchain\">Introducing the Solana Blockchain</h3>\n<p><strong>Solana</strong> is a blockchain platform that is designed to host decentralized and scalable applications. It is an open-source network, which means that developers can build and launch their own decentralized applications using it. Solana initially emerged as a rival to the Ethereum (<a href=\"link\">ETH</a>) blockchain. Like the latter, it offers smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s other core features include its high speed, with the potential to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, and low transaction costs averaging at $0.00025. Transaction fees on Solana are in the network’s native token, <a href=\"link\">SOL</a>.</p>\n<p>The Solana coin is a utility token that functions as a medium of exchange and helps prop up security on the platform via staking. The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former executive at Qualcomm, in 2017 and is currently run by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-solana\">A brief history of Solana</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-and-why-solana-was-created\">How and why Solana was created</h3>\n<p>Solana emerged in response to the scalability limitations of existing blockchain platforms such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BTC</a>) and Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Bitcoin price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believed that agreement on time was one of the biggest challenges of a distributed model.</p>\n<p>Yakovenko recognized that a reliable and accurate clock was crucial for network synchronization. As such, he began working on and developed the concept of <a href=\"link\">proof of history</a>. This technique allows for keeping time between untrusted computers, making network synchronization simpler and faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-exactly-is-solanas-proof-of-history\">What exactly is Solana’s proof of history?</h3>\n<p>The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism is Solana’s chosen technique to keep the time between computers that do not trust each other. The basic idea behind PoH is to use a &quot;timestamp&quot; that is generated by a central server and broadcast to all nodes on the network. This timestamp serves as a reference point for the network, allowing all nodes to agree on the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_26_18_PM_b5d4d80061.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.26.18 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"link\">Medium</a> </p>\n<p>To generate the timestamp, the central server creates a &quot;hash&quot; of a large amount of data (known as a &quot;PoH generator&quot;) and publishes it to the network. Each node on the network can then use this hash to verify the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p>The PoH generator is designed to be computationally expensive to create, ensuring it can only be generated by a central server and not by any individual node on the network. This helps to prevent any one node from manipulating the timestamp or the sequence of events.</p>\n<p>By using the PoH mechanism, Solana can achieve high levels of network synchronization and scalability, allowing it to process a large number of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement over other blockchain systems that lack a reliable clock and struggle to scale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-journey-to-the-solana-launch-yakovenkos-path\">The journey to the Solana launch: Yakovenko’s path</h3>\n<p>Solana was technically created in November 2017 when Anatoly Yakovenko published the whitepaper for the proof-of-history concept. This technique would serve as the foundation for the Solana project. With plans to weave all the world&#39;s transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called it Loom.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald <a href=\"link\">published</a> the first open-source implementation of the PoH technique on GitHub under the name Silk. The project quickly gained traction, and the team continued to develop it.</p>\n<p>By March 2018, the team rebranded the project as Solana, a nod to the small beach town where Yakovenko and his team lived and worked. In June of that same year, they had scaled the technology to run on cloud-based networks. The next month, they published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>After months of testing and development, the Solana mainnet went live on March 31, 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-price-evolution\">Solana price evolution</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-is-solana-worth\">How much is Solana worth?</h3>\n<p>Solana’s SOL token, like most cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price fluctuations. In the first few months after the launch, the Solana price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1.00.</p>\n<p>However, in late 2020, the price of Solana began to rise rapidly. Driven by the non-fungible token (NFT) hype and the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. SOL more than tripled to a peak of $18.00 in early 2021. Solana reached its all-time high of $258 in November 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_40_45_PM_ff2553a118.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.40.45 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Solana price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these gains were nearly wiped out by the end of last year due to the crypto crash and subsequent contagion. Solana’s price took a hard hit from FTX’s implosion due to its close association with the exchange and subsidiaries. SOL dropped under $10 in late December for the first time since February 2021. However, it has recovered in the past month to trade at $24.22 currently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-solana-coins-are-there\">How many Solana coins are there?</h3>\n<p>The Solana foundation revealed that the total number of Solana (SOL) coins to enter circulation is 489 million. At the moment, 260 million tokens are available on the market. </p>\n<h3 id=\"where-can-you-buy-solana\">Where can you buy Solana?</h3>\n<p>Solana (SOL) can be purchased on a variety of exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and <a href=\"link\">ChangeNow</a>. With a user-friendly interface and a wide variety of payment options, ChangeNow makes it easy for anyone to purchase SOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanas-major-developments\">Solana’s major developments</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2019\">Solana’s 2019</h3>\n<p>Right before the Solana mainnet launch, much of the team’s attention was on obtaining funding to develop its new crypto network. The project had already begun to gain traction.</p>\n<p>As such, the team was able to raise $20 million in a private token sale led by Multicoin Capital in Q1 2019. Other participants were Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2020\">Solana’s 2020</h3>\n<p>The year 2020 marked Solana’s emergence as the first blockchain to use proof of history. The platform launched on Mainnet Beta in March 2020, following successful fundraising and the launch of their public test network, Tour de SOL.</p>\n<p>That same year, <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href=\"link\">USDT</a>) launched Solana-native <strong>USDT</strong> and Circle partnered to make <strong><a href=\"link\">USDC</a></strong> a native stablecoin on the platform. Solana also held its first hackathon from October 28 to November 14.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Tether price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2021\">Solana’s 2021</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s 2020 hackathon and subsequent ones were a success, leading to an influx of developers and projects onto the platform. By December 2021, Solana had exceeded 1,000 projects and saw a significant rise in its price and daily active users. This propelled the SOL token to the fifth spot on the crypto list, surpassing <strong>Cardano</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<p>However, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for 17 hours. The platform had formerly gone down for 6 hours in December 2021, earning it a reputation for frequent outages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Cardano price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2022\">Solana’s 2022</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s outage problem persisted into 2022. Despite this, the network was able to make some progress. Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, announced integration with Ethereum and Polygon. In June, Solana revealed plans for the first crypto smartphone, the Solana Saga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/solana_saga_01_7aaaabbbc6.jpg\" alt=\"solana-saga_01.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>The platform also opened a physical store in New York City dedicated to all things crypto in July. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Solana_just_launched_a_physical_store_in_metaverse_79dcec4278.jpg\" alt=\"Solana-just-launched-a-physical-store-in-metaverse.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>Notably, Solana&#39;s NFT market experienced substantial growth in 2022, with the number of minted NFTs reaching 312,000 on September 7. Additionally, Solana NFT trading volumes rose to hit $11.5 million on September 6.</p>\n<p>However, in August, the platform&#39;s mobile wallet suffered a hack resulting in $8 million worth of losses. Thousands of Solana users suffered in the attack, which Solana ultimately blamed on a third-party platform, the Slope mobile wallet app. Solana experienced more losses later on as the FTX and Alameda saga caused the single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics as SOL dipped 96%. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solana-ecosystem\">The Solana ecosystem</h3>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem is home to a diverse range of projects, from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The platform’s speed, affordability, and scalability mean it is quickly becoming a go-to destination for developers, entrepreneurs, and users who want to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications and services. </p>\n<p>Among these projects are <strong>Phantom</strong>, a decentralized social network that empowers users to share content, earn rewards, and connect with others; <strong>Stepn</strong> (<a href=\"link\">GMT</a>), a platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows artists and creators to monetize their work. Solana also hosts <strong>Star Atlas</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ATLAS</a>), a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading digital assets, and <strong>Audius</strong>, initially built on Ethereum but moved to Solana in 2020, a decentralized streaming platform for musicians that enables them to control their music and earn royalties directly from fans.</p>\n<p>More recently, <strong>BONK</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BONK</a>),  “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people,” which was released in December 2020. </p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Like most other projects in the crypto industry, Solana reaped the benefits of 2021’s DeFi and NFT boom. In the same vein, it was unable to escape the impact of the crypto winter in 2022. Still, its attractive blend of speed and affordability, thanks to its unique technology, makes it a staple for most developers in this space. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest SOL trading pairs <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Also Read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/analyst-predicts-sols-price-prior-to-solanas-milestone-conference\">Analyst Predicts SOL’s Price Prior to Solana’s Conference</a></li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-26T19:28:00.275Z","createdAt":"2023-01-26T18:47:45.949Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-02T10:18:16.163Z"},{"id":1366,"title":"ChangeNOW stands against fraudulent actions amid Alameda wallets' suspicious activity","description":"Taking into account the company's high AML standards in terms of resistance to illegal activity, ChangeNOW is putting serious effort into preventing such incidents as the recent Alameda wallets’ case.","slug":"changenow-stands-against-fraudulent-actions-ensures-high-compliance-standards-amid-alameda-wallets-suspicious-activity","metaTitle":"ChangeNOW position amid Alameda suspicious activity","metaDescription":"The compliance team works round-the-clock with investigation inquiries related to Alameda funds movement","featuredImage":{"id":6782,"name":"12.28 Alameda Incident Statement-01.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Once fraudulent activity was first reported by investigators, the ChangeNOW compliance team responded immediately and blocklisted suspicious wallets.

Cryptocurrency has gained significant popularity in recent years as a decentralized, digital form of currency. However, without proper security measures in place, individuals risk losing their hard-earned digital assets to hackers and cybercriminals. Therefore, it is essential to understand and implement best practices for securing cryptocurrency to protect against potential threats. Below are a few ways to keep your crypto secure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_10_how_to_keep_your_crypto_secure_e5b6f96415.png\" alt=\"how to keep your crypto secure\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"use-a-hardware-wallet\"><strong>Use a hardware wallet</strong></h2>\n<p>A hardware wallet is a physical device that is designed to securely store cryptocurrencies. These wallets are considered to be one of the safest options for storing crypto, as they provide an extra layer of protection against hacking and other security threats.</p>\n<p>Using a hardware wallet is relatively simple. It&#39;s important to note that a hardware wallet is only as secure as you make it. First, you need to purchase a hardware wallet from a reputable manufacturer. Next, you will need to set up the wallet by following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. This typically involves creating a passphrase and writing it down in a secure location.</p>\n<p>Once your hardware wallet is set up, you can start using it to store your crypto. To do this, you will need to connect the wallet to your computer or mobile device using a USB cable. From there, you can transfer your crypto to the wallet using your preferred crypto wallet or exchange.</p>\n<p>Make sure to follow best practices for keeping your hardware wallet and passphrase safe, such as not sharing your passphrase with anyone and keeping the wallet in a secure location.</p>\n<p>Overall, using a hardware wallet is a great way to keep your crypto safe and secure. Whether you&#39;re a seasoned crypto investor or new to the world of cryptocurrencies, a hardware wallet is a valuable tool that can help you protect your assets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enable-two-factor-authentication\"><strong>Enable two-factor authentication</strong></h2>\n<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an important security measure that can help protect your accounts and assets. 2FA adds a layer of protection by requiring a second form of authentication beyond just your password. This can help prevent unauthorized access to your accounts, even if your password is compromised.</p>\n<p>There are several different types of 2FA that can be used to secure your cryptocurrency accounts. One common type is SMS-based 2FA, which involves sending a code to your phone via text message. Another option is app-based 2FA, which uses a dedicated smartphone app to generate codes. There are also hardware-based options, such as security keys, which are physical devices that you can use to authenticate your login.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the specific type of 2FA you use, the process is generally the same. When you log in to your cryptocurrency account, you will be prompted to enter a code that has been sent to your phone or generated by your 2FA app or hardware device. This code must be entered in addition to your password in order to gain access to your account.</p>\n<p>Using 2FA can help protect your cryptocurrency accounts and assets from being accessed by unauthorized parties. It&#39;s a simple, effective way to add an extra layer of security to your online accounts and is highly recommended for anyone holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency.</p>\n<h2 id=\"always-use-a-secure-exchange-for-transactions\"><strong>Always Use a Secure Exchange for Transactions</strong></h2>\n<p>Using a secure exchange is an important step in keeping your crypto assets safe. One option is to use a non-custodial exchange such as ChangeNOW. Using a non-custodial exchange means you are not at risk of losing your assets to a hack or a financial crisis. ChangeNOW is a popular choice for anonymous exchanges, offering a user-friendly platform and a wide range of crypto assets to choose from. Remember to always do your own research and due diligence before choosing an exchange, and make sure to use strong and unique passwords for all of your accounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-strong-unique-passwords\"><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords</strong></h2>\n<p>Using strong, unique passwords is an essential security measure for protecting your cryptocurrency accounts and assets. A strong password is one that is difficult for others to guess or crack, while a unique password is one that you don&#39;t use for any other accounts.</p>\n<p>There are a few key things to keep in mind when creating strong, unique passwords for your cryptocurrency accounts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess or crack your password.</li>\n<li>Make your password at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are generally more secure, as they are more difficult to crack.</li>\n<li>Avoid using common words or phrases as passwords. Instead, use a combination of unrelated words or a passphrase.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t reuse passwords across multiple accounts. If one account is compromised, this could potentially give an attacker access to all of your accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By following these tips, you can help ensure that your cryptocurrency accounts and assets are as secure as possible. It may take a little extra effort to create and remember strong, unique passwords, but the added security is well worth it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"secure-your-device-and-practice-good-security-habits\"><strong>Secure your Device and Practice Good Security Habits</strong></h2>\n<p>Aside from the recommended choice of cold wallets and other measures, it is also wise to practice good security habits. Here are some steps you can take to ensure the safety of your digital assets:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep your device&#39;s operating system and security software up to date. Cybercriminals often exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to gain access to devices and accounts.</li>\n<li>Be careful when clicking on links or downloading attachments, as they may contain malware that can compromise your device and steal your cryptocurrency.</li>\n<li>Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive transactions, as they may not be secure. If you need to use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t share your private keys or recovery phrases with anyone, as these give access to your cryptocurrency. Store them in a safe and secure location, such as a hardware wallet or a physical document that is stored securely.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"final-words\"><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>\n<p>In conclusion, keeping your Crypto safe requires a combination of best practices and choosing the right tools. This includes using strong and unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and storing your assets in a secure wallet. It&#39;s also important to choose a trusted and secure exchange to handle your transactions. By following these guidelines and staying vigilant, you can protect your Crypto and enjoy the benefits of this exciting technology with peace of mind.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-11T15:37:50.036Z","createdAt":"2023-01-11T15:37:43.415Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-11T15:43:19.269Z"},{"id":1357,"title":"Automatic Market Makers Explained","description":"Most decentralized exchanges that you know of run using Automatic Market Maker – a mechanism that holds liquidity and calculates exchange rates.

First, they figured out how to accumulate enough liquidity that DEXes were lacking back in the day. Second, they managed to abandon the cumbersome order book, making decentralized exchanges lightweight and speedy. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-амм\">What Is АММ?</h2>\n<p>Automatic Market Maker is an algorithm that keeps liquidity on a decentralized exchange and defines the asset prices. When a user enters an AMM-based DEX to swap their tokens, they trade not with other users, but with a liquidity pool of that exchange. </p>\n<p><strong>A liquidity pool</strong> is a smart contract where other users (<strong>liquidity providers, or LPs</strong>) lock their tokens for a reward. This allows everyone to trade with the liquidity pool, that is – swap the coins.     </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/11_25_Automated_market_makers_AMM_Curve_Uniswap_Balancer_01_dfe9a82bc9.png\" alt=\"Automated market makers\" ></p>\n<h3 id=\"how-is-the-exchange-rate-calculated-in-amm\">How is the exchange rate calculated in AMM?</h3>\n<p>Asset prices in a liquidity pool are defined automatically based on the supply-demand balance. Let’s consider a trading pair ETH/LINK. The ratio of these coins in the pool determines their exchange rate. If someone buys ETH for LINK, this means there is now less ETH and more LINK in the pool. ETH rises in price, while LINK drops. </p>\n<p>The rate is calculated via an AMM <strong>formula</strong>. The simplest one is implemented in Uniswap and looks like this: <strong>x * y = k</strong>, where** x** is the amount of token A, **y **is the amount of token B, and **k **is a constant meaning that the total liquidity of the pool remains unchanged. </p>\n<p>The concept of AMM has evolved over time, and there are now plenty of its different types. DEXes like Balancer allow creating pools for 3 and more tokens, while the AMM of Curve enables trading of assets with similar price: like ETH/WETH or USDC/DAI. </p>\n<p>AMM-based exchanges are a backbone of today’s DeFi. The total value locked in all DEXes is <a href=\"https://defillama.com/dexs\">$3.4 billion</a>, and most of them run on Automatic Market Maker.   </p>\n<h2 id=\"why-amm\">Why AMM?</h2>\n<p>To understand why AMM was invented, let’s see how all crypto exchanges had operated before. </p>\n<p>The cornerstone of a centralized exchange like Binance is the <strong>order book</strong> – a log where exchange rates are shaped. Traders enter the platform with a proposal to buy or sell an asset at a certain price, and the <strong>match engine</strong> connects users whose ask and bid prices… match. </p>\n<p>This is how the first decentralized exchanges on Ethereum operated, too. But their non-custodial nature suggests that all order book operations have to run on-chain – and this considerably hindered trading. When DEXes first emerged, Ethereum couldn’t boast enough speed and low fees to ensure a good user experience for order book-based DEXes. </p>\n<p>This is where AMM came on stage. It replaced order books with concise liquidity pool smart contracts that collected liquidity and defined the price. This made DEXes way more efficient and has helped form DeFi as we know it.  </p>\n<p>AMM was first proposed by the Gnosis founder Alan Liu. His ideas were outlined in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/\">Reddit post</a> by Vitalik Buterin in 2016 and then later described by Ethereum co-founder in his <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/06/22/marketmakers.html\">blog</a> in 2017. </p>\n<h2 id=\"risks-of-trading-in-amm\">Risks of Trading in AMM</h2>\n<p>Non-custodial decentralized trading comes at a cost, and AMMs have some risks that are missing in centralized platforms. They include **slippage **(relevant if you swap your tokens in a decentralized exchange) and <strong>impermanent loss</strong> (a threat for liquidity providers). </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-slippage\">What is slippage?</h3>\n<p>Slippage happens when the expected transaction price and the actual transaction price are different. In decentralized exchanges, this occurs because AMM adjusts prices in the pool when the amount of liquidity changes. In <strong>positive slippage</strong>, the price goes in a favorable direction and you receive more than expected, and in <strong>negative slippage</strong>, you get less. </p>\n<p>Most DEXes offer the tools to save you from negative slippage. By default, <strong>slippage tolerance</strong> is usually set at 0.1% or 0.5% – if the price changes unfavorably by more than this percentage, your transaction will revert. You can enter another slippage tolerance rate manually. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-impermanent-loss\">What is impermanent loss?</h3>\n<p>Impermanent loss is when the assets locked in a pool cost less than if you simply held them in your crypto wallet. </p>\n<p>This happens when the general market price and the one defined by the AMM are different. “Impermanent” means that until the provider hasn’t withdrawn their liquidity from the pool, their loss remains unrealized.  </p>\n<p>Let’s give it an example. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say, you’ve put 1 ETH and 1,200 DAI in a pool (at a 50:50 ratio). Let’s suppose that these funds are 10% from the total liquidity of the pool (so there is 10 ETH and 12,000 DAI overall). </li>\n<li>Ethereum market price suddenly surges to $2,400, but the price is still the same in your DEX. Nimble arbitrageurs come instantly to buy some cheap Ether.</li>\n<li>Now, there’s only 5 ETH and 12,000 DAI in the pool (whereas total liquidity has remained at the same $24,000 – remember the “k” from the formula?).</li>\n<li>Your share is still 10%. If you withdraw your liquidity right now, you will receive 0.5 ETH and 1,200 DAI. </li>\n<li>The funds that you withdraw will cost $2,400 – just like at the very start. But if you simply held ETH in your wallet, you would now have 1 ETH worth $2,400 plus 1,200 DAI. The loss stops being impermanent once you withdraw your liquidity from the pool. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In reality, such price swings occur far more smoothly. Extremely sharp market price changes are uncommon, and there are always arbitrageurs – bots that spot the price gaps between DEXes and smooth them out while earning the difference. </p>\n<p>Let’s now take a look at some of the most prominent decentralized exchanges leveraging the AMM model. </p>\n<h2 id=\"uniswap\">Uniswap</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_15_cc9dca40fd.png\" alt=\"unnamed (15).png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Uniswap_Logo_and_Wordmark.svg\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap\">Uniswap</a> is the first-ever AMM DEX launched in November 2018. It was conceived by a young engineer Hayden Adams soon after he was laid off from Siemens – which, in his words, was &quot;<em>the best thing that ever happened to me.</em>&quot; Adams simply started to learn Solidity, Ethereum’s programming language, and soon, the first AMM went live. </p>\n<p>Uniswap is a classic of decentralized exchanges with over $1 billion of total value locked. The DEX is available on Ethereum and its L2 chains (Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism) and boasts a radically simple design that has been copied by dozens of DEXes. The number of features available here isn’t high, but their convenience has secured the leading position of Uniswap: it’s super easy to connect a wallet, swap tokens, provide liquidity, and track pool statistics. </p>\n<p>Despite its simplicity, Uniswap always finds things to improve. In May 2020, the team launched Uniswap V2, enabling direct ERC-20 to ERC-20 token swaps – and making ETH unnecessary as an intermediary asset, which dropped the platform’s gas fees. Later in 2020, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/uniswap\">UNI</a> governance token was introduced, and in May 2021, Uniswap V3 was set in motion. The third iteration of the protocol enabled concentrated liquidity – a more efficient way for liquidity providers to allocate their funds in pools. </p>\n<h2 id=\"curve\">Curve</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_16_910951fccb.png\" alt=\"unnamed (16).png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logovectordl.com/curve-fi-logo-vector-svg/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/swap\">Curve</a> is an AMM focused on stablecoin trading. Liquidity pools of assets with similar value require a special technical solution, and Curve has managed to devise one. In Curve, you can swap DAI, USDT, USDC, FRAX, and many other tokens with low fees and slippage. </p>\n<p>The decentralized exchange is the second-largest in terms of TVL ($876 million), and besides Ethereum with its L2 networks, it operates on other blockchains like Fantom and Avalanche. Liquidity providers of Curve receive a reward in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/crv-erc20\">CRV</a> – a governance token for CurveDAO that can be used for decentralized governance of the protocol. </p>\n<h2 id=\"pancakeswap\">PancakeSwap</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_17_ed16c9ad4e.png\" alt=\"unnamed (17).png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pngall.com/ru/pancakeswap-crypto-png/download/85476\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pancakeswap.finance/\">PancakeSwap</a> is the largest decentralized exchange on BNB Smart Chain and the third-largest among all DEXes ($270 million of TVL). After BSC was launched in September 2020 with its revolutionary low fees, PancakeSwap has become the backbone of the nascent BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Luckily for BSC fans, PancakeSwap offers plenty of features inaccessible in Uniswap. For instance, liquidity providers can earn <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/pancakeswap-bsc\">CAKE</a> token as reward and stake it right here in “Syrup pools” to maximize their gains. In PancakeSwap farms, users can also stake LP tokens (assets that LPs receive as a representation of their share in the pool). Another feature that PancakeSwap enables is quite rare for DEXes — limit trading. </p>\n<p>In the Swap section, users can click the “Scan Risk” button to assess the credibility of a chosen token. This adds safety – there are thousands of tokens in BSC, and far not all of them boast secure smart contracts. </p>\n<h2 id=\"balancer\">Balancer</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_18_e603a7b492.png\" alt=\"unnamed (18).png\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://searchvectorlogo.com/balancer-fi-logo-vector-svg/\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://balancer.fi/\">Balancer</a> is an AMM released in March 2020 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The protocol is the fifth-largest DEX with $96 million of TVL.   </p>\n<p>In Balancer, users create liquidity pools of 3 and even up to 8 assets. LPs can deposit tokens not only in a 50:50 ratio like in Uniswap: it’s possible to provide the pool with, for example, 60% of ETH, 20% of MKR, and 20% of USDC. This makes Balancer pools similar to asset portfolios or even financial indexes. And these pools are customizable, which gives LPs more yield opportunities and grants regular users with favorable swap conditions.   </p>\n<p>Balancer also has its native token, BAL – LPs receive it as reward for depositing liquidity in pools. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/balancer\">BAL</a> and the tokens of other AMMs – <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/uniswap\">UNI</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/crv-erc20\">CRV</a>, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/pancakeswap-bsc\">CAKE</a> – are available on ChangeNOW instant crypto exchange service. Unlike a DEX, this platform allows trading 450+ assets from dozens of blockchains with an average swap time of 5 minutes. Anyone can use ChangeNOW without registration and hidden fees.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Ex editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T17:20:50.693Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-12-13T14:50:18.392Z","createdAt":"2022-12-13T14:50:12.615Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T14:50:18.409Z"},{"id":1347,"title":"What Are Token Standards?

With such a diversity of use cases, there is a need to make tokens coexist within one blockchain (that is, make them interoperable) while preserving the security of code and ensuring it’s easy to launch them. Token standards provide such unification. </p>\n<h3 id=\"a-digital-vending-machine\">A digital vending machine</h3>\n<p>Before we delve into particular standards, let’s mention something that lets them operate – smart contracts. Their developer Nick Szabo called them digital vending machines: when specific predefined conditions are met (snack is picked and the money is deposited), you receive the result (the snack) without any extra human-driven decisions or intermediaries. In this example, the money that you insert in the machine is tokens. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/11_17_What_are_Token_Standards_01_c830c1ff96.png\" alt=\"What are Token Standards\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-token-standards\">Ethereum Token Standards</h2>\n<p>In Ethereum, there is a document kit that instructs how to develop smart contracts. It’s called the ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment), it determines features of every token standard and ensures smooth communication between smart contracts. Anyone can propose their own ERC standard, but it has to be thoroughly reviewed by the Ethereum community first and accepted by a decentralized team of developers. </p>\n<p>Two most widely used Ethereum token standards today are ERC-20 and ERC721. </p>\n<h3 id=\"erc-20\">ERC-20</h3>\n<p>ERC-20 is the main Ethereum standard for <strong>fungible tokens</strong> – that is, all assets of this format are equal in terms of type and value. In other words, for instance, 1 DAI token always equals any other DAI token. </p>\n<p>The great majority of Ethereum tokens that you know are in ERC-20 standard. Here are their main types: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Utility tokens</strong> are necessary to get access to features in a certain application. They are used more for benefits within this dApp rather than as means of exchange or investment. For example, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/decentraland\">MANA</a> is a utility token that lets you pay for goods and services in the Decentraland metaverse. </li>\n<li><strong>Governance tokens</strong> allow users to manage a crypto platform in a decentralized form. These assets are used in voting regarding the protocol’s future, new features, and use of its treasury. <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/uniswap\">UNI</a> is the governance token of Ethereum&#39;s largest decentralized exchange, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/maker\">MKR</a> helps manage Maker protocol. </li>\n<li><strong>Stablecoins</strong> help users peg their crypto to fiat currencies. Some tokens like <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies\">USDT</a> are issued by a centralized entity, while others are minted by a decentralized lending protocol when a user deposits collateral (like the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dai\">DAI</a> stablecoin). </li>\n<li>**Liquidity pool tokens. **When you provide liquidity to a pool at a decentralized exchange, you receive an LP token that represents your share in this pool. For instance, if you put money in the <a href=\"https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x5777d92f208679db4b9778590fa3cab3ac9e2168\">USDC/DAI</a> pool on Uniswap, you will get a USDC-DAI LP Token. </li>\n<li><strong>Wrapped assets</strong> serve as Ethereum-based representations of another chain’s coins. Wrapped Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin\">WBTC</a>) is a well-known example. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>ERC-20 standard was proposed in November 2015 in a <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20\">EIP-20</a> personally by Vitalik Biterin. The Ethereum co-founder called it “a standard interface for tokens”: the platform was growing and many tokens of all kinds were being launched, so there was a need for a common framework. </p>\n<p>ERC-20 has become this framework. It allows tokens to be transferred and to be spent by other Ethereum-based dApps. An ERC-20 asset can be customized for governance, rewards, and more. Despite many imperfections, the standard has become ubiquitous. </p>\n<h3 id=\"erc-721\">ERC-721</h3>\n<p>In 2018, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal database added an <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721\">EIP-721</a> that described a standard for <strong>non-fungible tokens</strong>. Compared to fungible ERC-20 assets, these are not interchangeable: each one is unique and cannot be replaced by another. An ERC-721 asset is attached to a specific object. According to the original proposal, this object can be: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical property — houses or unique artwork,</li>\n<li>Virtual collectibles — unique pictures or collectible cards,</li>\n<li>“Negative value” assets — loans and other responsibilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Almost 5 years have passed since these words were written. How precise were the standard authors’ predictions, and how are ERC-721 tokens used today? </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Digital collectibles.</strong> Here, the developers were right – an <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/top-10-of-the-worlds-most-outstanding-nfts\">NFT boom</a> of 2021 was partially due to the surge of digital collections like CryptoPunks or the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The most expensive CryptoPunk #5822 has been recently sold for 8,000 ETH ($23.7 million).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Crypto_Punk_9ee2a22f06.png\" alt=\"Crypto Punk\" ></p>\n<p>One of the most expensive NFTs ever sold. <a href=\"https://medium.com/nswap/24-million-secret-behind-the-highest-ever-cryptopunk-5822-f3ee997e48e9\">Image source</a> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Game items.</strong> Unique in-game characters or cards all <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/play-move-learn-to-earn-how-to-monetize-your-passions\">exist</a> as NFTs, like the monsters in Axie Infinity. ERC-721 tokens are even used for off-chain games: in the STEPN move-to-earn app, you need to buy NFT sneakers to start receiving rewards for running. </li>\n<li><strong>Land in the metaverse.</strong> The aforementioned MANA ERC-20 token allows you to receive LAND – an NFT that represents land parcels in the Decentraland metaverse. </li>\n<li><strong>Unique artwork.</strong> Looks like EIP-721 authors were right about this one, too. NFT art trades are a million-dollar industry; in 2021, a compilation of works by digital artist Beeple <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/top-10-of-the-worlds-most-outstanding-nfts\">was sold</a> for $69 million. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a broader sense, ERC-721 non-fungible tokens are about proved digital ownership. When you possess an NFT, it means there’s a record  in a public immutable database trusted by everyone that you own a digital item. This has never been possible before blockchain and NFTs. </p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-standard-expands-to-other-networks\">Ethereum Standard Expands to Other Networks</h2>\n<p>As Ethereum gained traction, a massive ecosystem of dApps has emerged on top of it. But as years went by, it became clear that the network couldn&#39;t handle the increased demand in transaction volume: the blockchain frequently got congested, and the gas fees soared. </p>\n<p>To remain competitive, Ethereum announced the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/top-10-of-the-worlds-most-outstanding-nfts\">Merge</a> and all the subsequent scaling measures. But the crypto community doesn’t like to wait for profits – and many competitors to Ethereum have emerged. </p>\n<p>Their goal was not to create new ecosystems from scratch, but to move Ethereum-based dApps and tokens to new networks with faster transactions and cheaper gas. Consequently, token standards in new blockchains needed to remain similar to ERC-20. This is how EVM-compatibility emerged. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-evm\">What is EVM?</h3>\n<p>Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, is a distributed network of computers that collectively execute smart contracts. Regardless of the physical location, network members compute by the same rules without any centralized governance. </p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-an-evm-compatible-blockchain\">What is an EVM-compatible blockchain?</h3>\n<p>An EVM-compatible network operates by a set of rules that are very similar to original Ethereum rules. This way any Ethereum-based application can be easily deployed on this network with no need for reconfiguration – and users can enjoy the same features with lower gas fees and faster transactions. </p>\n<h2 id=\"evm-compatible-blockchains-and-their-standards\">EVM-compatible Blockchains and Their Standards</h2>\n<p>In 2022, there’s over a dozen large EVM-compatible networks: BSC, TRON, Avalanche, Fantom, Celo Network, Harmony, and others. This list also includes layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum (blockchains that run on top of it) such as Polygon and Arbitrum. </p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some of these networks’ token standards. </p>\n<h3 id=\"bep-20\">BEP-20</h3>\n<p>BEP-20 is the token standard of BNB Smart Chain – the second blockchain launched by Binance in September 2020. BEP-20 defines who and how can spend BSC-based tokens and other rules of their operation.</p>\n<p>The standard was designed as an extension of ERC-20 that would facilitate the launch of all kinds of assets. Powered by gas many times cheaper than on Ethereum, BEP-20 sparked the emergence of thousands of tokens on BSC. </p>\n<h3 id=\"bep-2\">BEP-2</h3>\n<p>It is worth noting that Binance has another token standard: BEP-2. It was inherent to Binance Chain, the first blockchain launched by Binance in 2019 for decentralized trading. However, the network hadn’t gained widespread adoption. </p>\n<p>In 2022, two networks <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/amp/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918\">merged</a> into one BNB Chain, and Binance chain became its governance layer. BEP-2 is compatible with ERC-20 and BEP-20, and tokens of two Binance standards can be swapped at the BSC Token Hub. </p>\n<h3 id=\"trc-20\">TRC-20</h3>\n<p>TRC-20 is the token standard for TRON, a blockchain-based operating system launched by the TRON Foundation under Justin Sun. The standard describes how new tokens must be issued, how their transfer is performed, and how assets are sent and received. </p>\n<p>The TRON Virtual Machine is EVM-compatible and uses the same programming language, Solidity. This ensures seamless integration of Ethereum smart contracts into TRON, while the platform’s high throughput guarantees low fees and high transaction speed. </p>\n<h3 id=\"perks-of-evm-compatibility-cross-chain-swaps\">Perks of EVM compatibility: Cross-chain swaps</h3>\n<p>ERC-20, BEP-20, and TRC-20 are highly interoperable token standards, and this allows for a direct value exchange between Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain and TRON blockchains. For example, you can easily swap USDT ERC-20 to USDT BEP-20 with minimal losses using the <a href=\"https://app.multchain.online/#/router\">Multichain</a> bridge.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"non-evm-compatible-networks\">Non-EVM-Compatible Networks</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, ERC-20 has some drawbacks that limit its capability. In an effort to make blockchain more efficient, some layer-1 networks have created their own token standards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nep-141--near-protocol\">NEP-141 – NEAR Protocol</h3>\n<p>NEAR is a blockchain of the new generation: it has had a sharded architecture from the very start, while Ethereum is only planning to implement it. The NEAR ecosystem boasts over 800 projects building in it and 400,000 daily transactions. </p>\n<p>NEAR has a few standards for fungible tokens, including NEP-141 and NEP-148. In contrast to NEAR native coin and ERC-20 assets, NEP-141 tokens are not stored in users’ wallets – rather, each token resides in its own contract. The latter has the data about how many tokens users own and handles transactions internally. </p>\n<p>Although the NEAR blockchain is not EVM-compatible, one part of its ecosystem is. Aurora blockchain runs on top of NEAR and creates a bridge between the latter and the Ethereum network. Currently, the TVL of NEAR and Aurora is about $127 million each. </p>\n<h3 id=\"cardano-native-tokens\">Cardano native tokens</h3>\n<p>Can tokens operate without a smart contract – and even with no token standard as we know it? Cardano says: they definitely can. In its network, tokens are <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/vasil-hard-fork-explained-what-changes-for-cardano\">“native”</a> to the blockchain – it already contains their code, and there’s no need for any extra. This reduces the risk of a human error: by removing smart contracts, Cardano gets rid of all their vulnerabilities and associated money loss risks. </p>\n<p>On top of that, Cardano tokens have the same status as the platform’s native ADA coin. On the contrary, in Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens are very distinct from ETH, which sometimes creates inconveniences to users. </p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Token standards define the common rules that all tokens of a certain kind have to follow. Ethereum’s most widely used ERC-20 standard establishes fungible tokens like UNI or DAI, and ERC-721 is for NFTs. </p>\n<p>EVM-compatible networks apply a similar standard (like BEP-20 for BNB Smart Chain or TRC-20 for TRON) so that Ethereum apps could easily migrate there. These blockchains are interoperable and connect via cross-chain bridges.</p>\n<p>Non-EVM-Conparible networks like NEAR and Cardano have their own token standards.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Ex editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T17:20:50.693Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-11-22T17:27:50.911Z","createdAt":"2022-11-22T17:26:38.233Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-22T17:27:50.932Z"},{"id":1343,"title":"What Is Automated Crypto Trading, And What Are the Best Crypto Trading Bots?","description":"The crypto market is an ever-changing landscape that never sleeps, so modern times require novel and automated solutions to stay at the top of your game.

The solution is taking advantage of modern technology and using <strong>automated crypto trading</strong> to work in your favor. Trading doesn’t have to be complicated when you can configure computer systems to automatically analyze, predict, and execute market orders in your name. </p>\n<p>Let’s see how crypto automated trading really works. What types are there, and what are some of the platforms and services you should definitely check out to maximize your profits on cryptocurrency markets. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/11_03_Automated_Crypto_Trading_01_5249e598e8.png\" alt=\"Automated Crypto Trading\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-crypto-trading-bots\">What Are Crypto Trading Bots?</h2>\n<p>Simply put, the term automated crypto trading refers to the use of special software called trading bots to buy and sell selected cryptocurrencies based on the instructions you gave it. Since the programs can operate autonomously, the trader doesn’t have to be present to manually press the ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ buttons on an exchange. By now, we are sure you can already see the benefits of automation and how much time such strategies can free up for you to focus on other things.</p>\n<p>Crypto bots monitor market movements and use algorithms to execute orders with precision. These modern apps use various strategies and can buy or sell crypto at certain prices or when specific technical indicators are aligned. Compared to you and me, automated crypto trading is emotionless. </p>\n<p>Is crypto bot trading profitable? Computer software will not succumb to emotions like fear, stress, or greed. That makes them ideal trading companions because even if you become attached to a digital asset, your crypto bot will sell it for profit in the blink of an eye.           </p>\n<p>Automated trading bots don’t get tired. They don’t need to rest, take breaks, go out for dinner, or watch a movie. We, the people, need all of that, and when we do, we can be sure that our digital helpers will continue the work for us. The app will always do what it was configured for by following the parameters provided to it.</p>\n<p>Most crypto traders want to buy the dip and sell assets at their peak. But this isn’t an exact science, and waiting too long can result in failing to take profits. Bots don’t have those problems because hesitation is not part of their configuration. </p>\n<p>Automated trading software can be tested in simulated environments before allowing the application to trade with real money. Following the results in demo mode lets you know what to expect in live market conditions.</p>\n<p>A few seconds too early or too late differentiates a good trader from a less successful one. Crypto automated trading makes portfolio diversification easier. Working with dozens of coins on multiple markets can be troublesome for humans, but not for crypto bots. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-types-of-automated-crypto-trading-are-there\">What Types of Automated Crypto Trading Are There?</h2>\n<p>Crypto trading bots can essentially be divided into two types: <strong>APIs</strong> and <strong>blockchain</strong>-<strong>based</strong>.</p>\n<p>Most automated crypto trading is done through APIs. An API is an <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> where you can establish a connection between an account on a cryptocurrency exchange and that of the bot you are using. The software then gains access to your profile and is able to perform buy and sell actions instead of you.</p>\n<p>The other type of automated trading uses <strong>the blockchain</strong> directly. It utilizes the code in <strong>smart contracts</strong> to perform financial activities autonomously. Since Ethereum is the world’s biggest smart contracts platform, most of these types of software reside on this network.</p>\n<p>Automated bots can also be classified into 5 groups:     </p>\n<h3 id=\"arbitrage-bots\">Arbitrage Bots</h3>\n<p>Arbitraged bot trading means buying cheaper on one exchange and selling higher on a different one to take advantage of the price difference and make a profit. This strategy often requires multiple trades back and forth since the margins might be minimal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"coin-lending-bots\">Coin Lending Bots</h3>\n<p>Coin lending bots can automatically lend coins to margin traders on cryptocurrency exchanges, which will eventually be paid back with interest.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"marginleverage-bots\">Margin/Leverage Bots</h3>\n<p>If you can automate the lending process, you can also automate borrowing. Margin bots borrow coins from lenders to execute margin trades instead of humans.</p>\n<h3 id=\"market-making-bots\">Market-Making Bots</h3>\n<p>Market-making bots monitor crypto exchanges to provide liquidity for them. These tools can be configured to submit buy and sell orders above or beyond the asking price. They make a profit by purchasing a little cheaper when the value decreases and selling when the market goes up. </p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-trading-bots\">Technical Trading Bots</h3>\n<p>This type of automated software tries to predict future price trends based on specific signals or indicators. They can even copy and imitate your favorite crypto traders to perform the same market actions as them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-legal-side-of-automated-crypto-trading\">The Legal Side of Automated Crypto Trading</h2>\n<p>But is crypto bot trading legal? Using automated trading software is legal, and the cryptocurrency niche isn’t the only industry that takes advantage of them. They have their use in traditional stock markets, for example: Wall Street relies on various bots when it comes to fiat currency exchanges, bonds, and the equities market. Software is unquestionably faster and more efficient than people.</p>\n<p>Depending on the jurisdiction, local laws and directives might regulate how crypto bots can be used. Not all automated trading software is legit and created with good intentions. Some don’t deliver everything they promise, and others can be plain scams. It’s important to remember that if trading or owning cryptocurrencies is considered illegal in your jurisdiction, the use of automated crypto trading tools can’t be allowed either.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-4-most-popular-platforms-for-automated-crypto-trading\">The 4 Most Popular Platforms for Automated Crypto Trading</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, there is no shortage of crypto bots to choose from. In the segments below, you can read about 4 that are believed to be worth trying out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wundertrading\">WunderTrading</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Wunder_Trading_1645994642.jpg\" alt=\"Wunder Trading\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wundertrading.com/en\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wundertrading.com/en\">WunderTrading</a></strong> is an automated trading bot for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. The software can be coupled with a long list of popular crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Bitfinex, and many others.</p>\n<p>The bot can easily be set up and assimilate scripts from TradingView to achieve the best results.

Loans and lending platforms, savings, and the stock market are other parts of the system. The problem is that the majority of financial services we use today are centralized. They mostly rely on a central entity that’s in control of the financial flow. This approach can be dangerous because we are dealing with a single point of failure. Issues such as fraud, corruption, or the mismanagement of funds have all happened in the past, proving centralized systems to be somewhat unreliable.</p>\n<p>DeFi is the answer to government-controlled financial institutions. Decentralized finance is based on blockchain technology that allows anyone to keep independent records of the status of all transactions. This effectively solves the problems revolving around single points of failure, puts users in control of their own money, and gets rid of intermediaries and middlemen. Thanks to DeFi, cryptocurrencies can now penetrate more perfected financial markets and widen their use cases.</p>\n<p>Decentralized Finance services operate independently of a central authority. There isn’t a company or person in charge of DeFi platforms. They rely on cryptocurrencies that are based on smart contracts and can perform programmable tasks. That allows crypto users to build a whole ecosystem of decentralized exchanges and platforms for lending and borrowing money.</p>\n<p>DeFi takes advantage of the Ethereum blockchain&#39;s strengths to develop and run all its decentralized apps and services. Ethereum is the biggest network of smart contracts which holds the codebase and rules that indicate how a specific app is supposed to work. The code is the rule in Ethereum. Once a smart contract of a decentralized app or service is released to the blockchain, no single entity has any control of it anymore. It becomes autonomous and irreversible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_31_Academy_2_De_Fi_and_Passive_Income_from_Crypto_02_06ecf042c9.png\" alt=\"DeFi &amp; Passive Income from Crypto\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-history-of-defi\">The History of DeFi</h2>\n<p>Let’s go back in time to understand how the DeFi movement was born. Bitcoin was created in 2009. Some readers might wonder, why not simply use Bitcoin as the backbone of the decentralized financial industry? Well, Bitcoin’s language is simply not suitable to run dApps. However, the coin prompted other developers to create more robust infrastructure, such as that of Ethereum, in 2015.</p>\n<p>Ethereum was used as a foundation to create a decentralized lending platform Maker DAO, one of the first major DeFi projects. Maker DAO is considered to have laid the groundwork for the future of the DeFi industry. In 2017, we witnessed the creation of EtherDelta, a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on the Ethereum blockchain. This DEX facilitated trades between ERC-20 tokens and ether.</p>\n<p>During the 2017/2018 ICO era, several DeFi platforms were created. They are still popular today. Those are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AAVE – a lending and borrowing app</li>\n<li>Synthetix – a derivatives liquidity protocol initially known as Havven</li>\n<li>0x – a P2P token exchange and liquidity aggregator</li>\n<li>Bancor – a decentralized exchange</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During that period, developers learned that it was easier for people to interact with smart contracts and use platforms that pooled together all the money of its users instead of having them deal with each other in a P2P manner. This interaction model was better suited for DeFi. </p>\n<p>One such network that was created in 2018 was Uniswap. Users of this platform interacted with liquidity pools rather than with individual traders. During 2018/2019, a few other networks were launched in the DeFi space, such as Compound, Ren, and Kyber Network.</p>\n<p>The summer of 2020 was the period when decentralized finance protocols soared. It began with Compound creating a liquidity mining program, where users were rewarded with COMP tokens for lending and borrowing digital assets. Compound incentivized other development teams to get involved, like Yearn Finance. Its native token (YFI) was listed at $6 on Uniswap and rose with incredible momentum to over $30.000 in just two months. This is how the “DeFi summer” kicked off.</p>\n<p>We then witnessed the introduction of Ampleforth algorithmic stablecoin and Sushiswap decentralized exchange. In September 2020, Uniswap hosted a massive airdrop that rewarded all its users with 400 UNI tokens worth over $1,200. This sparked new interest in the platform as the monthly trading volume of Uniswap increased from $200 million at the beginning of 2020 to $15 billion in September 2020. After some ups and downs, the year 2020 <a href=\"https://defillama.com/\">ended</a> with over $15 billion worth of digital assets locked up in various DeFi platforms. </p>\n<p>But the explosive growth of DeFi in 2020 was just the beginning. The total amount of value locked in all protocols continued to increase through 2021 and reached a whopping $181 billion in December. New protocols emerged every day and offered improved mechanics and liquidity mining programs, which is why they were dubbed DeFi 2.0. Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum and new layer-1 blockchains made transactions cheaper and faster, and cross-chain bridges made it easy to move funds across different platforms.</p>\n<p>2022 was starting well, despite a slight decline in users’ activity. But then the human factor failed DeFi enthusiasts: the notorious Anchor protocol couldn’t maintain an ultra-high APR and decreased it, Terra’s stablecoin UST crashed, and a huge market crisis was triggered. In just one month, the total value of all DeFi protocols halved and stands at the $55 billion mark now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-elements-of-a-decentralized-financial-system\">The Elements of a Decentralized Financial System</h2>\n<h3 id=\"stablecoins\">Stablecoins</h3>\n<p>A decentralized financial system needs a stable currency to preserve and exchange value. We can’t use Bitcoins because they aren’t operational on the Ethereum blockchain. Ether (ETH) is too volatile for this goal. Stablecoins, on the other hand, are perfect tools because they are pegged to the actual value of fiat currencies like the USD.</p>\n<p>One of the most widely used stablecoins in DeFi is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tether-erc20\">Tether (USDT)</a> – but it’s managed by a centralized entity and is not fully suitable for a decentralized economy. One of the alternatives is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dai\">DAI</a>, a decentralized stablecoin that is backed by cryptocurrencies instead of fiat money. The value of collateral behind DAI greatly exceeds its own one – this overcollateralized nature acts as protection against market volatility and sudden price drops. DAI can be purchased on exchanges, or you can borrow it in the MakerDAO protocol.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decentralized-exchanges-dexes\">Decentralized exchanges (DEXes)</h3>\n<p>The second element of DeFi is decentralized exchanges. These platforms operate on the Ethereum blockchain and allow traders to buy and sell digital assets based on the rules laid out in the underlying smart contracts.</p>\n<p>DEXes have several advantages over centralized exchanges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no need to register, submit identifiable personal information or undergo KYC verification.</li>\n<li>DEXes don’t require withdrawal fees which can amount to up to $50 when using centralized platforms.</li>\n<li>There are no geographical restrictions or banned countries because DEXes are available globally.</li>\n<li>The users trade directly from their Ethereum wallets, limiting the potential of losing money if the exchange gets hacked or exit scams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s examine the most popular ways to make money using DeFi services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yield-farming\">Yield Farming</h2>\n<p>One of the ways to take advantage of the DeFi space is being involved in yield farming. Farmers deposit their cryptocurrencies in liquidity pools. Those assets are then borrowed by other users while the lenders earn yield for the provided liquidity.</p>\n<p>The earliest and most lucrative yield farming opportunities were provided by Compound Finance. It’s a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing various cryptocurrencies. Similar to the stablecoin DAI, Compound is also overcollateralized. All lenders earn interest from the borrowers for lending them their coins. But <strong>borrowers</strong> receive an additional incentive in the form of COMP tokens for borrowing from the platform. The COMP tokens&#39; value made it cheaper to borrow crypto assets because the more you borrowed, the more COMP you would earn. As time progressed, COMP became more valuable than the initially borrowed coins, so users kept borrowing even more.</p>\n<p>Since the demand for Compound Finance kept increasing, the interest rates for <strong>lenders</strong> went up as well. Besides the yield they earned from the interest rates, lenders were also rewarded with COMP tokens. The real magic started when lenders were allowed to take loans based on the crypto they already deposited as liquidity. The new loans were lent again, earning even more interest and additional COMP tokens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"liquidity-providers\">Liquidity Providers</h2>\n<p>Providing liquidity to trading pools allows users to earn interest when their assets facilitate exchanges between different ERC-20 tokens. Some of the popular brands in this niche include Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, and Synthetix. Protocols running on other blockchains are also highly popular due to lower fees and greater transaction speed – for instance, PancakeSwap on BNB Smart Chain or SocialSwap on TRON.</p>\n<p>A liquidity provider usually allocates two tokens in equal proportion creating a trading pair between those two assets. ETH/BAT is an example of a liquidity pool that consists of ether and Basic Attention Token. The lender’s interest is to allocate equal amounts of each token so that the initial price doesn’t rise/fall, creating arbitrage opportunities for other traders. Arbitrage trading would result in the loss of revenue for the lender.</p>\n<p>The person who provides liquidity is called an LP. These users receive LP tokens  for their services proportionally to the amount of liquidity they provided. When an exchange occurs involving a trading pair an LP allocated liquidity to, the lender receives a percentage of the trading fees. To withdraw the initial assets, the LP needs to burn their LP tokens.</p>\n<p>Each performed trade adjusts the price of the underlying tokens depending on the quantity that was exchanged. The technical term for this feature is Automated Market Maker or AMM. If a user purchases ether from an ETH/BAT liquidity pool, they automatically lower the total supply of ETH and increase BAT. That positively affects the value of ETH but lowers the price for BAT. The price movement depends on the liquidity allocated to the pool and the size of the facilitated trade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"staking\">Staking</h2>\n<p>Staking allows users to earn crypto rewards simply by storing their coins in suitable wallets or exchanges.</p>\n<p>In Proof of Stake blockchains like <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/the-merge-explained-one-step-closer-to-scalable-ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, staking is used to secure the network. A person who wants to hold a stake has to freeze their funds for a certain period, and then they are allowed to validate blocks. The larger the stake, the higher the probability of being selected as a validator.</p>\n<p>In DeFi, staking is different – it’s neither the means to secure the network nor the way to ensure consensus. In decentralized finance, staking helps projects improve their tokenomics: if users don’t sell an asset and lock it in the blockchain, that helps maintain that token’s price. Obviously, users are rewarded for freezing their coins.</p>\n<p>One of the opportunities of this kind is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/tokens/now-staking\">NOW Token staking.</a> If you <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/now-token\">own</a><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span>some NOW, you can lock it in your wallet in a few clicks and start earning up to a 25% APR with rewards coming weekly. The minimum amount for staking is just 10 NOW. The longer you stake, the higher will be your reward. </p>\n<p>Another popular option is staking LP tokens – those that represent your share in a liquidity pool after you put your funds in it. Staked LP tokens incentivize users to continue providing liquidity to pools, thus maintaining the stability of the protocol. As an example, you can stake LP tokens on BSC-based PancakeSwap and earn the platform&#39;s native CAKE tokens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"liquid-staking\">Liquid staking</h3>\n<p>As Ethereum switched to the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, ETH staking was introduced. But solo staking requires tech skills and 32 ether, so developers created the services where it is possible to stake a smaller sum.</p>\n<p>One of these solutions is Lido protocol. Its main advantage is that when you lock your ETH in the platform, it sends you the equivalent amount of stETH (staked ether) tokens that you can freely use. This way the value of your ETH is not completely frozen, and you can leverage it in DeFi or other domains of the crypto market. </p>\n<h2 id=\"airdrops\">Airdrops</h2>\n<p>An airdrop is a marketing activity where developers send out a new token to crypto users’ addresses. Tokens are given away to promote a project and get the community interested in the issues that the particular currency is trying to solve. Airdrops are an easy way to earn some crypto, hoping that the coin might one day experience a good price swing in your favor. Moreover, some airdropped tokens offer utility or governance opportunities to their owners.</p>\n<p>In its most simple form, an airdrop would require you to submit a receiving address that will eventually be topped up by some free tokens. But airdrops have evolved in recent years, and they now need some additional information. This marketing strategy is beneficial to token creators as well, not just the receivers. Interested parties are often required to fill out a form where they need to submit their emails and social media profiles. In many cases, users need to follow or like Twitter and Facebook pages of the projects and complete simple tasks like retweeting and commenting on posts. In exchange for free coins, the developers receive an extensive database of potential new investors and customers.</p>\n<p>To receive an airdrop, you need an ERC-20-compatible wallet such as <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a> or MetaMask. Airdrops can be found via social media and crypto-related media sites. Ensure that you never hand out sensitive information like private keys, which could result in the loss of funds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>DeFi has enabled cryptocurrency holders to earn interest on their digital assets in several different ways. To almost 1.4 billion people worldwide who don’t possess a bank account, decentralized services offer financial independence.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to get involved in DeFi is to use lending and borrowing platforms to farm yield and allocate funds to liquidity pools, creating trading opportunities for others. Users are then rewarded with a percentage of the fees and in some cases, with platform’s native tokens. These earnings can be staked to increase income. It is also possible to stake ETH in liquid staking protocols and use stETH tokens to leverage other DeFi opportunities. Lastly, users can take advantage of airdrops to increase their stock of digital assets.</p>\n<p>New decentralized financial opportunities are created every day. It will be fascinating to see how far up the ladder DeFi can go.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Ex editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T17:20:50.693Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-11-08T16:54:44.289Z","createdAt":"2022-11-08T15:57:09.082Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-08T16:54:44.309Z"},{"id":1313,"title":"Common Crypto Trading Strategies","description":"The volatility of the crypto market means that it can never be too late to trade in it, and with new currencies popping up all over the place, many are bound to hit new price points.","slug":"common-crypto-trading-strategies","metaTitle":"Common Crypto Trading Strategies","metaDescription":"The volatility of the crypto market means that it can never be too late to trade in it, and with new currencies popping up all over the place, many are bound to hit new price points.","featuredImage":{"id":6183,"name":"10.07 Academy 1 Common Trading Strategies-01.png","alternativeText":"Common Crypto Trading Strategies","caption":"","hash":"10_07_Academy_1_Common_Trading_Strategies_01_84f804b1ab","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_07_Academy_1_Common_Trading_Strategies_01_84f804b1ab.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_10_07_Academy_1_Common_Trading_Strategies_01_84f804b1ab.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_10_07_Academy_1_Common_Trading_Strategies_01_84f804b1ab.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_10_07_Academy_1_Common_Trading_Strategies_01_84f804b1ab.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_10_07_Academy_1_Common_Trading_Strategies_01_84f804b1ab.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>That said, there are several ways to profit off of the crypto market. However, you need a trading strategy to combine those ways into a structure you can follow. </p>\n<p>There are many crypto trading strategies out there. But before we go any further, there are two main schools of thought you need to understand before choosing or building your own trading strategy: Technical analysis and Fundamental analysis. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/10_07_Academy_1_Common_Trading_Strategies_01_84f804b1ab.png\" alt=\"Common Crypto Trading Strategies\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"technical-analysis-ta\">Technical Analysis, TA</h2>\n<p>Technical analysis, also known as charting, involves studying statistics, previous trends, and numerical changes in terms of price and volume fluctuations in a bid to predict future market behavior. Most traders use this as a tool for identifying trends and favorable trading opportunities. </p>\n<p>At its core, TA is the study of traders&#39; and investors&#39; emotions (mainly fear and greed) through the relation of an asset&#39;s price to the opposing forces of demand and supply. In other words, the previous change in the price of an asset is a reflection of traders&#39; emotions, which is an important factor in the cryptocurrency market. </p>\n<p>While technical analysis is a useful tool, it is best suited to markets that operate within normal conditions (i.e., high volume and liquidity). This is because abnormal markets (low volume and liquidity) can be easily manipulated by external forces, resulting in false signals, hence rendering TA useless. </p>\n<p>To carry out TA, traders use what we call technical analysis indicators. While there are numerous indicators out there, some of the most used ones include: Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), etc. </p>\n<h2 id=\"fundamental-analysis-fa\">Fundamental Analysis, FA</h2>\n<p>In addition to technical analysis, traders use fundamental analysis to help them make more accurate decisions beyond simple statistics by analyzing qualitative factors, such as market capitalization, company management, reputation, affiliations, etc. The goal of FA is to predict the psychological impact of the price of an asset. (.i.e., do traders think an asset is overvalued or undervalued?). </p>\n<p>In fundamental analysis, predicting an asset&#39;s future price behavior involves more than its previous performance. It involves understanding the industry-specific market and considering the economic factors that may affect price behavior in that market. </p>\n<p>On that note, FA seeks to determine how less tangible and qualitative factors, such as the ones above, affect the overall performance of a project. </p>\n<p>Having discussed what technical and fundamental analysis are about, next up is a trading plan. Before we look at the common trading strategies, let&#39;s discuss what a trading plan should include. </p>\n<h2 id=\"elements-of-trading-strategies\">Elements of Trading Strategies</h2>\n<p>A trading plan must include three main elements: </p>\n<h3 id=\"market-entry-and-exit-points\"><strong>Market Entry and Exit Points</strong></h3>\n<p>A mouse click on an order DOM or a call to a broker is all it takes to execute a trade, but knowing the right point to execute that trade is a rather technical affair. </p>\n<p>Understanding the entry and exit points of a market is a crucial element of any trading strategy. You need to do your research. However, it is common practice to enter a market at its support level and exit at the next resistance level. </p>\n<h3 id=\"risk-management\"><strong>Risk Management</strong></h3>\n<p>Most traders see effective risk management as the key to a successful trading plan. This is because risks are inevitable in the crypto market. However, with a risk management plan, you can assume full control over how much risk you take on a specific trade.</p>\n<p>One way traders manage risk is by setting a stop-loss limit, a few units below the entry point or support level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"psychology-trading\"><strong>Psychology Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>Most inexperienced traders often overlook psychology when building a trading plan. But to build a successful trading plan that would maximize profit, you need to adopt a strategy that suits your psychological makeup. </p>\n<p>In other words, your trading plan must be user-friendly, understandable, and trusted by you (to promote discipline in its implementation). </p>\n<h2 id=\"active-crypto-trading-strategies\">Active Crypto Trading Strategies</h2>\n<p>As the name implies, active strategies require that you stay active within the market. That is, constantly studying charts, monitoring price behavior, and managing your portfolio. </p>\n<p>Here are some of the most common active trading strategies:</p>\n<h3 id=\"day-trading\"><strong>Day Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>Day trading involves making and closing an order within 24 hours, using hourly analysis as an aid to make decisions. This trading strategy is also referred to as high-risk trading because it often involves small price differences or large fluctuations. This can negatively affect investors that are prone to emotional trading.</p>\n<p>For advanced traders who prefer to automate trading and direct all their strategies using trading bots, crypto day trading is perfect. There are numerous website options where you can find charts with hourly and daily data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arbitrage-trading\"><strong>Arbitrage Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>This trading strategy is common in the crypto trading industry due to characteristic large fluctuations on an hourly basis. There are numerous exchanges and trading centers, enough to provide investors the room to buy fast and sell even more quickly. This strategy&#39;s game plan is to accumulate small profits from several transactions within a day or an hour. </p>\n<p>To achieve this game plan, you need to buy cheaply in one transaction and sell high on the other to make a quick profit. The upside of this strategy is that it reduces the risk of losses. But its downside is that you depend on the exchange rates on different platforms; this can make your efforts pointless if the exchange rates do not favor you. </p>\n<p>Therefore, only use this strategy if you have everything in place. Also, you need substantial knowledge of the currencies you&#39;re trading as well as how to use a trading bot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swing-trading\"><strong>Swing Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>The swing trading tactic leverages cryptocurrency graphs to point out trends within a certain period. The cryptocurrency market doesn&#39;t move in a straight line like the supply and demand chat we knew back in economics class. It moves in both directions (rise and fall). Swinging in the market refers to spotting a repeating price behavior over a specific period, then making decisions (buying or selling) to capitalize on the price behavior. </p>\n<p>This tactic is common amongst experienced traders, those with strong knowledge of the market, and the ability to understand charts and indicators. Chart platforms or mobile apps are essential for this strategy. Understanding peaks and drops are imperative to making profits with this strategy. </p>\n<h3 id=\"trend-trading\"><strong>Trend Trading</strong></h3>\n<p>The trend trading strategy is much like the swing tactic, except with a slight twist. Where swing is to short-term trading, the trend is to long-term trading. You study major events behind a particular price behavior, but this time you&#39;re more interested in long-term changes as the aim is to spot substantial price differences. </p>\n<p>This strategy has the potential to make more profits than swing trading tactics. However, it requires large investments, and you can suffer heavy losses for wrongly reading signs. And while swinging is suitable for experts, trend trading can accommodate starters as well. </p>\n<p>Bear in mind that the cryptocurrency market is volatile, and prices can change abruptly. While this strategy can make you significant profits, you can lose your money quickly as well. </p>\n<h3 id=\"scalping\"><strong>Scalping</strong></h3>\n<p>Crypto scalping is similar to arbitrage trading. This strategy is based on the idea that smaller but numerous trades a day is the best tactic to make a profit. While this trading method can work on days where there are abrupt changes in the price, it should be used sparingly. </p>\n<p>You can also indulge in this trading tactic if your goal is to make small profits while taking the lowest risks possible. It is great for starters to use this strategy for a trading test-run to get a feel of the market. </p>\n<h2 id=\"passive-crypto-trading-strategies\">Passive Crypto Trading Strategies</h2>\n<p>Unlike with active strategies, you are allowed a more hands-off approach with passive trading strategies. In other words, constantly monitoring your portfolio is not a requirement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hodl-buy--hold\"><strong>HODL (Buy & Hold)</strong></h3>\n<p>Buy and Hold in the crypto dictionary is known as HODL, which translates to hold on for your dear life in English. This strategy involves the trader looking to buy a cryptocurrency when the price is low and hold it until the market trends (buying and selling) take the price higher. </p>\n<p>According to this strategy, the price will keep rising with time, meaning the more you wait, the larger your profit. But that isn&#39;t always the case. </p>\n<p>This strategy has its merits and demerits. For the former, buying a coin and lending it out for profits is possible. You don&#39;t have to go through the hassle of complex daily analysis; instead, you concentrate on long-term indicators. </p>\n<p>On the demerit side, you stand to suffer heavy losses if your long-term analysis goes wrong. For example, bitcoin rose to a whopping $20,000 in 2018, only to fall back to $4000 at the end of the year. But in the long run, HODL is a great strategy as evident in its rebound to an all time high of $62,000 in April 2021. </p>\n<p>Note, for HODL strategy, you need a secure and trustworthy trading option. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>While trading cryptocurrency can be very lucrative, you need a robust trading strategy to ensure efficient use of capital in the face of a very volatile market. Study through the common strategies in this article, choose one that best suits you. </p>\n<p>Note that it isn&#39;t compulsory to use one strategy forever, you can evolve as you gain more trading experience. </p>\n<p>For whatever strategy, ensure consistency and strict adherence. If possible, create a trading journal to aid in analyzing your trading strategy. It is also advisable to use different strategies on different parts of your portfolio. This way you can measure different strategies’ performance to know which suits you best.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-10-13T15:58:36.852Z","createdAt":"2022-10-13T15:58:35.505Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-13T15:58:36.864Z"},{"id":1277,"title":"Is Crypto Traceable?

Banks or governments can’t mess with digital currency that is safely stored on your cryptocurrency wallet. Bankruptcy or frozen accounts won’t affect your assets either.</p>\n<p>But since cryptocurrencies are the product of the blockchain architecture, there are a few things that don’t go well with each other. When storing data on distributed ledger, privacy, anonymity, and data protection are not absolute and have their own peculiarities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Privacy_Anonymity_Montazhnaya_oblast_1_13f5157160.jpg\" alt=\"Crypto Privacy, Anonymity, &amp; Data Protection\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"is-crypto-traceable\">Is Crypto Traceable?</h2>\n<p>There is no such thing as absolute anonymity when conducting any type of financial operations online. And cryptocurrency transactions are no exception. Whenever you make a transaction, your data is collected and analyzed. Linking your transactions to your credentials can help service providers speed up the settlement process. At the same time, it kills the whole idea of privacy because all your activities are monitored and recorded. With crypto, things are not that different and one cannot say it is one hundred percent anonymous but rather pseudonymous.</p>\n<p>Very few coins offer you complete privacy, and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> itself is far from being anonymous.  To start with, it is almost impossible to buy cryptocurrency without providing your ID. Some exchanges offer no-KYC purchases, but this option is available only for smaller amounts that don’t usually exceed a couple of hundreds USD. And when you use your passport to buy crypto, anonymity is out of the picture. </p>\n<p>Since all the legal exchanges are regulated, the government can get access to their records when necessary and track any Bitcoin transaction. Services like <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chainalysis</a> – it works with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash – help trace transactions and link them to people who made them.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin and most other coins won’t guarantee your anonymity unless you use special services to trick the system. For example, crypto mixers (or crypto tumblers) allow you to “mix” your coins with transactions of others and get new “clean” coins. Alternatively, a mixer will substitute your coins with other coins from the wallets hooked to it. Bitcoin mixers are still legal, but they have to be registered, obtain a license to operate, and comply with the AML policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-privacy-coins\">Top Privacy Coins</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency community is known for being passionate about privacy and freedom. That’s why enthusiastic developers created several coins that are focused on keeping their owners anonymous. Typically, they also offer advanced security and are partially or almost fully private. Let’s take a look at some of the most popular privacy-oriented coins.</p>\n<p><strong>Monero (XMR)</strong></p>\n<p>One of the oldest privacy-focused coins, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/monero\">Monero</a>, is using such technologies as ring signatures and stealth addresses to make its transactions untraceable. </p>\n<p>Ring signatures allow a sender to hide their identity from everyone else in the group. When signing a Monero transaction, the sender&#39;s private and public keys are combined; that helps to make the transaction unique and private. Randomly generated single-use stealth addresses bring on some extra privacy for the receiving side. </p>\n<p>This way neither sender nor receiver are exposed when they transact in the Monero ecosystem. The amount of the transaction stays hidden, too, due to the use of the RingCT technology. </p>\n<p>All Monero’s transactions are private, and you cannot send a transparent transaction even by mistake, which makes it the most anonymous coin on the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Zcash (ZEC)</strong></p>\n<p>The second largest privacy-oriented cryptocurrency is <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/zcash\">Zcash</a>. Unlike Bitcoin, Zcash enables semi-transparent processing to reveal transaction data selectively. The coin uses a Zero-Knowledge Proof cryptographic tool: it helps to prove that a statement is true without revealing this statement. So, in the Zcash network, a transaction can be confirmed without disclosing its details. It also allows its users to shield transactions. This way you don’t need to know anyone’s address to send or receive Zcash tokens. The transaction amount stays hidden, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Dash (DASH)</strong></p>\n<p>Another famous privacy cryptocurrency, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dash\">Dash</a>, enables users to choose if they want their transactions to be anonymous or not. Thanks to the PrivateSend feature, you can hide only some of your transactions or keep them open if the regulatory framework of your region requires you to do so.</p>\n<p>To reach consensus, Dash uses a modified version of Proof of Stake – the X11 algorithm. This algorithm is not based on the concept of mining and uses a system of Masternodes (stakeholders) to validate transactions. Dash’s Conjoin mixing tool shuffles transactions and enhances privacy.</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, governments are not the biggest fans of privacy coins. These coins are usually associated with criminal activities on the darknet. Some countries prohibit listing privacy coins on cryptocurrency exchanges, but they are still not banned officially. </p>\n<p>And yet there’s nothing bad about privacy, and anonymity is not a crime. Everybody (and cryptocurrency and cryptography enthusiasts in particular) loves their privacy, and it’s only fair that such coins exist.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"specifics-of-data-protection\">Specifics of Data Protection</h2>\n<p>Blockchain is a technology meant to protect your data from manipulation. All the records are public and immutable, so you stay confident that nobody will mess with them. Blockchain copies data, and stores it in many places (nodes) instead of keeping it centralized. The entire copy of the master ledger is stored on every single node of the chain, and these nodes communicate with each other to validate the data and make sure it is accurate and up-to-date. </p>\n<p>However, some aspects of blockchain’s architecture might contradict local regulatory requirements. For example, there is a data protection regulation in the EU law – General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – which establishes a certain set of rules challenging compliance of the blockchain and cryptocurrency projects operating in the area.  </p>\n<p>Given that data on the blockchain is distributed to many places, it does not belong to a single owner. This goes against data privacy regulations as it requires a single owner responsible for personal data. A possible solution to this challenge suggests storing index numbers linked to the personal data in a separate database and assigning one owner (for example, an organization) that can be held accountable. </p>\n<p>Another big challenge is that blockchain doesn’t provide an option of deleting the data. All the information that has ever been recorded on a blockchain will stay there. The blockchain can change, but it will still have the record of what it used to be before that without the possibility to erase this information. Although it can be useful in some cases, data regulations are strict about the capability of deleting the data of the users whenever there’s a need for that. In this case, storing an encrypted copy of personal data in a separate database would also come in handy. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Despite popular opinion, Bitcoin and most of the other cryptocurrencies are not anonymous but pseudonymous. They provide their owners with a certain level of privacy but do not guarantee full anonymity. There are services that help track transactions and link them to the senders. Bitcoin mixers and privacy coins are meant to solve the anonymity issue, although they often fall into disfavor of the governments and are considered to be the tools for carrying out criminal activities. </p>\n<p>Transparency makes blockchain almost immune to attacks and allows us to store data securely. However, the same characteristics make it difficult to keep our personal data private since it is out there in the open. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-09-06T10:23:13.979Z","createdAt":"2022-09-06T10:23:11.811Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-06T07:51:32.264Z"},{"id":1224,"title":"Blockchain Technology in Financial Services and Banking","description":"Just like any other technology, distributed ledger technology is meant to level up our way of living.

They can contribute to faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions and change the banking industry profoundly. More and more banks and financial institutions worldwide are looking into the new technology in hopes to organize their work more efficiently. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Blockchain_in_traditional_finance_Montazhnaya_oblast_1_666062227e.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain in Traditional Finance\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"scope-of-application\">Scope of Application</h2>\n<p>Traditional financial institutions can choose to work with blockchain to advance their services, otherwise they face a serious competition. Blockchain networks and the evolving DeFi movement aim at transforming the way we handle our financial affairs and allowing people to be their own banks. </p>\n<h3 id=\"blockchain-technology-in-banking\"><strong>Blockchain Technology in Banking</strong></h3>\n<p>Apart from being slow and expensive, banking as we know is not universally accessible today. Banking is not available for many people living in third-world countries as they live in rural areas and often lack necessary documentation. Blockchain can provide access to personal banking services, insurance, mortgages, and loans to anyone regardless of their level of wealth or location, considering that they have a phone and access to the internet. </p>\n<h3 id=\"new-types-of-services\"><strong>New Types of Services</strong></h3>\n<p>Traditional financial institutions are also quite conservative and they do not often keep up to date with innovations. Blockchain-powered solutions can offer a broader perspective and let people work with derivatives, futures, staking, all sorts of lending, and other products. </p>\n<h3 id=\"uncensored-services\"><strong>Uncensored Services</strong></h3>\n<p>When you trust a third-party with your money, there’s always a risk of losing control over it. Government restrictions, censorship, and even bankruptcy – when you’re not a sole owner of your assets, it’s not up to you to keep it safe. Blockchain solutions such as wallets, decentralized exchanges, and various DeFi applications do the opposite: they give you back your right to manage your funds independently. </p>\n<h3 id=\"common-applications\"><strong>Common Applications</strong></h3>\n<p>Blockchain tech has the power to dramatically improve a wide range of financial services such as cross-border money transfers, trade finance, capital markets, trading platforms, clearing and settlement, identity verification, fraud detection, credit score reporting, and more. </p>\n<p>An improved way of sending money, alongside the high level of security and privacy when handling data, are two of the most basic and yet important use cases for the blockchain tech. Let’s have a closer look at them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blockchain-technology-for-money-transfers\">Blockchain Technology for Money Transfers</h2>\n<p>International money transfers remain an expensive and rather slow affair. Companies like Western Union have almost zero competition in terms of person-to-person money transfers but the services they provide are far from perfect. Apart from charging substantial fees, the process of money transferring is not as fast. And it is also inconvenient. In a world where you can order anything online, going to a physical location with your passport and having to deal with lines and operators seems like a burden. </p>\n<p>As for the debit and credit card transfers, they do not always work internationally and even if they do, the speed is slow and commission fees are high. When it comes to sending money overseas, our current banking system is still stuck in the past: a simple transaction should go through a complex infrastructure. </p>\n<p>When you want to send assets from one bank to another, these banks need to connect to each other and verify the details of this transaction. Blockchain tech can help banks communicate with one another seamlessly, bypassing the issue of correspondent banking. Instead of sending requests, banks could use a single database for recording and verifying transactions, various contracts, and documents. </p>\n<p>Eliminating intermediaries from the money transferring process is one of the most vital functions that blockchain has to offer. Giving access to the unified trustless database means that there is no need for controlling third-parties. A blockchain-powered peer-to-peer network allows us to send money directly to each other. </p>\n<p>Ripple is one of the best examples of how financial institutions and blockchain companies can work together in terms of advancing the money transferring process. American Express, MoneyGram, Santander, and hundreds of other financial institutions in more than 40 countries have joined RippleNet to provide a faster, cheaper, and more transparent way to send money internationally. </p>\n<p>Although slow in accepting innovations, every year banks around the world are getting serious with implementing solutions within their infrastructure. Banks in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and nearly half of the banks in China have already started implementing distributed ledger technology in their operations. And it’s just the beginning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blockchain-for-advanced-privacy-and-security\">Blockchain for Advanced Privacy and Security</h2>\n<p>When it comes to handling data, blockchain can guarantee a high level of security and privacy. One of the benefits of using distributed ledger technology is that all the data is not being stored locally, so it is a lot harder for attackers to target a single point of failure. It is a lot safer than trusting third-parties to store your information. It is more transparent, too: blockchain creates a universal shared source of truth that is available for everyone on the network. Distributed ledgers also allow network participants to cooperate and come to agreements more effectively. </p>\n<p>These characteristics make blockchain tech ideal for executing operations with finance and other transactions that involve sensitive data as they become harder to attack, easier to monitor and reach consensus when working at the same task. </p>\n<p>Here are two most promising security-focused areas where blockchain tech will come in handy.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Identity</strong></p>\n<p>In case you lose access to your banking app, you’ll have to resolve the issue the old-school way: bring your ID to the bank yourself or undergo a long process of verifying your identity that involves making selfies holding today’s newspaper, showcasing your social media profiles, and other things that take time and violate your privacy. Alternatively, you can safely store your digital identity on blockchain and even categorize the data according to your personal needs and enhance privacy. </p>\n<p><strong>KYC/AML</strong></p>\n<p>Same goes for KYC and AML procedures. Today banks have to spend millions on compliance and still the cases of fraud are not entirely eliminated. Blockchain tech can allow companies to access digital identification and verification of their clients and exchange data with one another to confirm the details. This will significantly improve and accelerate the work of compliance departments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>The scope of blockchain application in the world of traditional finance is limitless. Distributed ledger technology with its improved way of storing and managing data opens up new opportunities for managing your personal finance. </p>\n<p>By integrating blockchain into banks we can achieve faster, cheaper, and safer transactions. It will also deal with fraud more effectively, reorganize and structure the work of compliance departments, help with handling the KYC and AML procedures, and revolutionize the way the banks handle our data.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-07-29T11:13:28.435Z","createdAt":"2022-07-29T11:13:20.485Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-04T20:11:57.920Z"},{"id":1213,"title":"Cryptocurrency Regulations Worldwide Explained ","description":"As cryptocurrencies become ubiquitous, most states and regional entities are starting to develop legal frameworks for digital assets.

As of 2021, there are countries with more or less elaborate virtual assets legislation on every continent. Those regulations are bound up with international AML and CFT laws and reflect the state’s policy on exchanges, ICOs, taxation, mining, trading, digital assets’ status, and more.</p>\n<p>A universal and international set of crypto laws is yet to be designed. For now, different countries put their own regulations in place. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Crypto_legislation_Montazhnaya_oblast_1_177ea6e12c.jpg\" alt=\"Crypto Legislation Worldwide Explained\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"europe-crypto-regulations\"><strong>Europe Crypto Regulations</strong></h2>\n<p>The European Union has one of the most elaborate legal frameworks for crypto in the world. Storing, trading, selling, and buying crypto is legal in the EU; however, taxation and exchange regulations vary from country to country. The Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (introduced in January 2020) brought the European crypto industry under strict AML legislation. European legislators presented a draft of a bill that promises to provide a blueprint for the region’s crypto law. The project seeks to establish a legal framework and competitive promotion of cryptocurrencies on this growing market, protect crypto holders and the funds they invested.  </p>\n<p>Some of the EU members have peculiar local cryptocurrency regulations. For instance, Malta is a very progressive country in terms of Bitcoin law: digital coins are recognized as “a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value” on a state level. There is no special taxation policy for crypto in Malta, and VAT is not applicable to exchange transactions. Estonia also proved to be a country of innovative approach, recognizing crypto as “a value represented in digital form” and licensing exchanges under strict AML and KYC rules. </p>\n<p>As for non-EU members, some of them tread in the EU’s footsteps. The United Kingdom hasn’t deemed crypto a legal tender yet, but the government regulates exchanges: they are required to register with the FCA. Digital assets are partly taxed in the UK, depending on the types of activities and investments. Belarus is another state that welcomes crypto investors, allowing buying, selling, and mining crypto on its territory. However, there is no legal framework for ICOs and crypto exchanges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"asia-and-australia\"><strong>Asia and Australia</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"singapore-crypto-regulations\">Singapore Crypto Regulations</h3>\n<p>In Asia, the states have varying approaches to crypto, Singapore being one of the much favored options among fintech projects. This country recognizes crypto as goods and charges a local VAT analogue, Goods and Services Tax. Exchanges are legal and regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>\n<h3 id=\"south-korea-crypto-regulations\">South Korea Crypto Regulations</h3>\n<p>South Korea has a favorable climate for crypto — digital financial assets are legal and tax-free at the moment. The government, one of the largest investors in cryptocurrencies, has taken measures to diminish crypto-related tax crimes. In China, storing and trading cryptocurrency is completely banned. Meanwhile, Hong Kong, China’s pain in the neck, grabbed the opportunity to become a regional crypto power and started creating a solid legal framework and a licensing system for exchanges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"indonesia-crypto-regulations\">Indonesia Crypto Regulations</h3>\n<p>Indonesia recognizes cryptocurrencies as commercial merchandise, implementing a series of requirements for crypto operators, such as anti money laundering compliance and risk assessment. Japan has undoubtedly the most nuanced and well-thought crypto legislation in Asia. The state recognizes digital assets as property and taxes them as a “miscellaneous income” (15%-55% rates). Exchanges have to undergo a registration process with Japan’s Financial Services Agency. It imposes rigorous AML/SFT rules on them and demands high-level cybersecurity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"australia-crypto-regulations\">Australia Crypto Regulations</h3>\n<p>Australia elaborated a comprehensible virtual asset regulatory policy, declaring exchanges legal and treating crypto as property (subject to Capital Gain Tax).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-americas\"><strong>The Americas</strong></h2>\n<p>North and South America have been very open regarding cryptocurrencies, as only two countries in the region, Bolivia and Ecuador, prohibit them completely. </p>\n<h3 id=\"us-crypto-regulations\">US Crypto Regulations</h3>\n<p>Since federal and state authorities in the USA treat crypto differently, there are a lot of uncertainties in the cryptocurrency regulation field. Though digital coins are not considered legal tender, exchanges are recognized by FinCEN as “money transmitters”, but stay in the legal grey area. Meanwhile, the IRS treats crypto as property and taxes it respectively. As if it was not enough, the SEC identifies crypto assets as securities, complicating things for American crypto operators even further. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mexico-and-canada-cryptocurrency-regulations\">Mexico and Canada Cryptocurrency Regulations</h3>\n<p>Things are not looking brighter in Canada: the crypto industry is underregulated, leaving room for maneuvering. Exchanges are technically legal and are required to comply with AML rules. Mexico, on the contrary, got serious about crypto regulations and elaborated a decent framework under Central Bank’s supervision. Digital coins were defined as “virtual assets” and required to abide by strict AML laws.</p>\n<h3 id=\"argentina\">Argentina</h3>\n<p>Argentina, despite being one of the countries with a widespread use of crypto, does not yet have formal crypto legislation. There are some tax regulations in place, such as the 2018 reform of the income tax law that set a ceiling of 15 % for the tax burden on cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"africa-cryptocurrency-regulations\"><strong>Africa Cryptocurrency Regulations</strong></h2>\n<p>Africa is yet to join the international crypto legislation club: the overwhelming majority of countries on the continent have next to no legal guidance on crypto. Out of 54 independent states, only a handful have coherent Bitcoin regulations; crypto is completely banned in Morocco, Algeria, Libia, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In Egypt, a religious state legislator prohibited using Bitcoin under Islamic law.</p>\n<p>South Africa doesn’t recognize crypto as a legal tender, but attempts to tax it as income and capital gain at the same time. The South African Reserve Bank’s instructions are scarce and controversial. A similar situation has come about in Nigeria, where the state legislators issued a set of legal guidelines for crypto-related projects only to warn the citizens against using crypto a couple of months later.</p>\n<p>The lack of CFT and AML legislation in Africa combined with overall instability of African countries’ economies arouse concerns about the future of crypto in the region. Some major players on the digital assets market try to adopt crypto regulations of European or Asian countries; others turn to FATF for guidance. In any case, for now, the African crypto industry is regulated from the outside. The rules are enforced mainly by the players themselves as compliance with international law gives them credibility.</p>\n<p>On the African continent, an excellent situation exists for cryptocurrencies, since political instability and mistrust in local currencies, added to the large number of smartphones and the minimum number of people with bank accounts, paved the way for cryptocurrencies to be a better option. By 2018, many countries in this continent did not have much knowledge about this type of assets, that is why they outlined a plan to observe other economic groups such as the EU, America and countries such as Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore and their progress in regulations. In 2021, after 2 years of research, countries like South Africa and Nigeria have begun to carry out projects to regulate the activity through their value and stock commissions, being the examples for the rest of the continent.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-07-19T11:36:18.751Z","createdAt":"2022-07-19T10:23:33.113Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-04T19:22:08.634Z"},{"id":1134,"title":"Cryptocurrency Exchanges And Trading Explained","description":"Why do stock exchanges exist?

If there are people that want to buy a stock and people that want to sell a stock, why do they need a stock exchange? The answer is surprisingly basic if you think about it for a moment. Let’s say you wanted to purchase some Apple stock, where would you go to buy that stock? You can’t call Apple to buy their stock, because the entire notion of stock is that Apple sold these stock shares to the general public. So if you wanted to buy five shares of Apple, you would have to track down somebody who owns that stock. And if he or she doesn’t want to sell the stock, you would have to track down somebody else. </p>\n<p>This all sounds pretty tedious. And that’s where stock exchanges come in. A stock exchange is essentially a meeting place for buyers and sellers. Before the digital age, these meetings took place in physical space — if you wanted to purchase or sell stock, you would go down to the physical stock exchange and transact (or, more likely, you would commission a broker to trade for you for a small fee). With the advent of the internet and virtual trading, much of this practice has been digitized and takes place in virtual space. But the concept of an exchange is still the same. It is a place for buyers and sellers to meet up and transact with each other.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/cryptocurrency_exchanges_and_trading_explained_6e0fc78cea.png\" alt=\"Cryptocurrency Exchanges And Trading Explained\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"exchanges-for-cryptocurrency\">Exchanges For Cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency is no different than any other asset, and cryptocurrency exchanges began to spring up in the 2010s, with Bitcoinmarket.com opening as the first exchange on March 17, 2010. In 2014, Mt. Gox, a crypto exchange that had been handling roughly 70% of all Bitcoin transactions at that time, closed down in a massive scandal. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (roughly 850,000 tokens) had been stolen from Mt. Gox after it was hacked. But crypto exchanges have come a long way from the bumbling and insecure exchanges of a few years ago. ChaneNOW, Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, and a host of other exchanges provide optimum security, ensuring the safety and security of their clients’ funds while allowing for split second transactions. The crypto exchange industry is arguably more robust than even the most trusted stock exchanges.</p>\n<p>Each exchange offers the same basic services — matching up buyers and sellers of crypto — but the supporting features of each can be quite different. There are three primary considerations when deciding which exchange to trade on. The first is whether the platform is suited for beginners or advanced users. Many exchanges fill the screen with a bevy of useful information, but all of this information can be overwhelming for a beginner. ChangeNOW, for example, treats users to a seamless user interface with the most important functions and information, and trading is a breeze on the platform. In contrast, other platforms include a slew of useful information and features that experienced traders might desire, such as price charts, trade history, and the order book. </p>\n<p>The second consideration when selecting an exchange is transaction fees. Each exchange service charges a percentage fee of each trade engaged in by the user. On some exchanges, fees can be as high as 2% per transaction. However, on other platforms, fees can be as low as .1%. You may not think that fees are very important, considering how minimal they seem, but when we get to the “trading” section of this post, you will see what a huge difference these percentage fees can make. So be sure to check the fees on an exchange before selecting it as your go-to platform. And if you do pick the exchange with higher fees, your choice should be justified by the wider range of useful features or information offered by the platform.</p>\n<p>The third important consideration to take into account when selecting an exchange is which tokens are supported by the platform. These days there is much more in the crypto world than just Bitcoin. In fact, there are thousands of altcoins traded on crypto exchanges every day. Some exchanges support, or list, tens or hundreds of different crypto tokens, while others are restricted to just a few cryptocurrencies. If you plan on buying more mainstream crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum, chances are that it will be listed. But if you’re getting into crypto for a particular token, you must make sure that the exchange you select lists the token you are interested in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crypto-trading\">Crypto Trading</h2>\n<p>There are many people that invest in crypto. Even some institutional investors, like Paul Tudor Jones III, have begun to stash some of their wealth in Bitcoin. However, aside from this sort of investing, there is a wide swath of the community that engages in trading. Crypto investing and crypto trading sound like similar enterprises, but they are actually worlds apart. The most elemental difference between the two is that investors are generally in it for the long haul, while traders look for short term gains. Investors generally engage in intense research that is focused on the long term potential and if its daily price fluctuates wildly, or even dips for a considerable amount of time, the investor holds on to their assets. Daily fluctuations and down periods do not phase the hardy investor, because he knows that eventually the price will go up.</p>\n<p>A crypto trader is an entirely different sort of person. Traders try to take advantage of crypto’s daily price fluctuations and capture the trading upside available in such volatile assets. Let’s imagine the typical day of a crypto trader. He wakes up at 9am and checks his current crypto holdings, which stand at 0.5 Bitcoin (roughly $10,000). By 10am Bitcoin’s price has increased 1% and our trader’s 0.5 Bitcoin is now worth $100 more than it was an hour ago. At this point, our trader will likely liquidate his holdings, and now wait for the Bitcoin price to dip below what the price was at 9am, at which point he will exchange his $10,100 for something resembling 0.505 Bitcoin. Or, he will purchase another token, like Ethereum, in the hopes that it now rises just as Bitcoin did. Lather, rinse, repeat. Our trader will continue this process throughout the day hopefully making a nice profit from crypto volatility.</p>\n<p>Traders should be concerned with two primary limits on trading profits (other than the obvious notion that prices can go down or up at an inopportune time). Firstly, every exchange platform carries trading fees. As discussed above, for each exchange (or swap) you make from fiat currency to cryptocurrency and back again, the platform charges you some percentage of the trade in fees. For example, if you exchange $200 for X Bitcoin, the platform may charge a 0.5% fee, which amounts to $1. Before you laugh off that miniscule fee of $1, remember that traders typically make only a few percentage points off of each trade, often as little as 1%. This means that the 0.5% fee amounts to roughly half of a trader’s total profits — not so miniscule after all.</p>\n<p>The second thing for a trader to be aware of is that crypto trading requires constant monitoring to take advantage of the opportune times to buy and sell. Of course, there are mechanisms like limit and stop orders that allow for a certain degree of automation in the process, but unless you are able to program your own functional trading algorithm, you will still have to check in on prices very often. Many traders enjoy the thrill of watching their small gains at first, but their enthusiasm eventually fizzles out as the small gains made from each trade no longer get them going, and they do not have the patience to sit and monitor prices constantly. If you want to trade successfully, you have to motivate yourself to get excited about the incremental profits by recognizing the potential of sustained growth over a long period of time. Fees and constant monitoring define the life of a crypto trader and if you want to make a profit trading, they will define your life as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Crypto exchanges are the average person’s window into the world of crypto and crypto trading. Without exchanges, we would have to hunt down buyers and sellers and rely on their trustworthiness as trade partners. We are lucky to live in an era with secure and efficient exchanges where we do not have to worry (as much) about our crypto being stolen from the exchanges we trade on. However, if you want to trade crypto, you must be cognizant of fees and continuously monitor crypto prices if you want to make a profit. Otherwise, you won’t need a hacker to lose all of your money, as you’ll be able to take care of that yourself.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-04-21T11:20:45.207Z","createdAt":"2022-04-21T11:20:42.566Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-21T12:55:20.327Z"},{"id":1125,"title":"How to Stake BEP-2 NOW Tokens in NOW Wallet ","description":"ChangeNOW has added the function to stake BEP-2 NOW Tokens to its NOW Wallet for users to benefit from it, while also contributing to the network's stability.","slug":"how-to-stake-bep-2-now-tokens-in-now-wallet","metaTitle":"How to Stake BEP-2 NOW Tokens in NOW Wallet ","metaDescription":"ChangeNOW has added the function to stake BEP-2 NOW Tokens to its NOW Wallet for users to benefit from it, while also contributing to the network's stability.","featuredImage":{"id":4592,"name":"04.07 How to Stake BEP-2 NOW Tokens in ChangeNOW Wallet-01.png","alternativeText":"How to Stake BEP-2 NOW Tokens in NOW Wallet ","caption":"","hash":"04_07_How_to_Stake_BEP_2_NOW_Tokens_in_Change_NOW_Wallet_01_b26f870817","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/04_07_How_to_Stake_BEP_2_NOW_Tokens_in_Change_NOW_Wallet_01_b26f870817.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_04_07_How_to_Stake_BEP_2_NOW_Tokens_in_Change_NOW_Wallet_01_b26f870817.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_04_07_How_to_Stake_BEP_2_NOW_Tokens_in_Change_NOW_Wallet_01_b26f870817.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_04_07_How_to_Stake_BEP_2_NOW_Tokens_in_Change_NOW_Wallet_01_b26f870817.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_04_07_How_to_Stake_BEP_2_NOW_Tokens_in_Change_NOW_Wallet_01_b26f870817.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>NOW Token can be <a href=\"https://changenow.io/tokens/now-staking#staking-block\">staked</a> to get paid interest on frozen user tokens.

There are different kinds of coins, like Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins, security, governance, and utility tokens, and unique ways of raising capital, like ICOs and STOs. That is a lot of technical terms for one paragraph, but by the end of this article, you should have a basic handle on what these terms mean, as well as how they impact the crypto economy. All of these terms are important because they are fundamental to understanding why the flexibility and unique nature of the crypto economy is rife with exciting possibilities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/03_10_Crypto_Economy_and_Tokenomics_01_bd055ad8f5.png\" alt=\"Crypto Economy &amp; Tokenomics Explained\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"token-types\">Token Types</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> is the crypto that started it all, but as Satoshi Nakamoto’s revolution took hold, myriad other digital tokens began to pop up everywhere. These tokens were labeled “altcoins” by the crypto community, short for alternative coins. Having a basic grasp of the different types of crypto tokens is key to understanding what motivates actors in the crypto economy. Some of these different types of tokens are utility tokens, stablecoins, security tokens, and governance tokens. What follows is an overview of each of these classes of tokens.</p>\n<p>A utility token is what is most commonly thought of when people think of crypto. It is a token whose value rises and falls like a stock based on the market’s interest in a project. Utility tokens are therefore directly tied to the value of a project. Bitcoins are utility tokens, which rise in value when the market values Bitcoin more, and fall in value when the market values Bitcoin less. The volatility of Bitcoin has laid the groundwork for some of the strongest criticisms of utility tokens as a replacement for fiat currency. Imagine if when you left your house to go to the store, a thousand dollars could buy you a brand new laptop, but by the time you got there, the value of the dollar had plummeted, and a laptop now costs five thousand dollars. As of 2020, if Bitcoin were used as a replacement for fiat currency, this sort of thing would occur frequently. </p>\n<p>A stablecoin is a digital token designed to minimize price volatility, and solve the major issue with utility tokens. Stablecoins solve this problem by pegging their tokens to some stable asset or combination of assets, whether fiat currency, gold, or even another less volatile cryptocurrency. Pegging a token to an asset essentially just means that the group managing the token holds the stable asset or assets in reserve (like a large pile of dollars). Holders of the token can always trade in their tokens in exchange for the asset. In this way, investors are assured of their tokens’ value and do not have to worry much about inflation or volatility.</p>\n<p>Security and governance tokens are probably the two types of tokens that beginners have not yet heard of. A security token acts more like a vehicle for investment (and as such, they are always subject to the SEC’s KYC and AML regulations).  Security tokens are digital proof of ownership for any asset that already has value like real estate or stock. This basically just means that a security token does not have any inherent value, instead representing an ownership stake in some other valuable asset.</p>\n<p>Governance tokens are simply administrative tokens that allow holders access and rights to participate in governing crypto projects. Such governance implies hiring and firing, including new features, and even changing governance schemes or protocols. These tokens are essential in the seamless administration of crypto projects, and will become precious commodities when crypto eventually goes mainstream. The power of a company CEO, CFO, manager, and board of directors will all be wielded via governance tokens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tokenomics\">Tokenomics</h2>\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects of crypto is the flexibility developers have in distributing and managing the tokens they create. This so-called science of the token economy has been coined tokemonics, the discipline of coin creation, management, distribution, and removal from a blockchain. The variety of methods available in tokenomics enables vastly different functionality. For example, arguably Bitcoin’s most valuable feature is the absolute cap of 21 million tokens that can ever be produced or distributed. Not only that, but there is only one way to receive Bitcoin directly from the blockchain — mining. This feature is why investors like Paul Tudor Jones and others have called Bitcoin a modern gold in the sense that it is fully protected from the dangers of inflation. Other cryptos, like <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, do not have any cap on supply, instead continuously doling out tokens to encourage transactions on its network.</p>\n<p>Another example of tokenomics at work is the flexibility in how tokens are distributed. Tokens can be distributed like Bitcoin, with miners receiving tokens for every verified block up until the total supply dries up. They can also be distributed on a fixed schedule in a string of ICOs, with buyers bidding on the price of new tokens. And crypto tokens can of course be distributed like fiat currency, with a centralized company issuing new tokens based on whatever they think is most beneficial to the currency (see <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/algorand\">Algorand</a>, for example). Perhaps the most fun distribution scheme is through lotteries and giveaways. Tokens like Banano and <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/now-token\">NOW</a> token often employ this method of supply distribution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"raising-capital-for-crypto\">Raising Capital For Crypto</h2>\n<p>There are a few primary methods for raising capital in crypto. One tried and true method is simply seeking investors, those who believe in a project and are willing to inject it with their own capital. The other methods (which are unique to crypto) are called an initial coin offering, or ICO, and a security token offering, or STO. These options are similar to initial public offerings (IPOs) where a company issues shares of stock to the public. In an ICO, the company or individual behind a crypto issues tokens to the public in exchange for capital. Usually, the developer will put out a white paper describing the technology and utility of the token to attract investors. Unlike IPOs, ICOs are almost entirely unregulated, so investors have to be very careful which ICOs they participate in to avoid getting duped or defrauded. This also means that ICOs have more flexibility than IPOs in terms of the value of each token that they offer.</p>\n<p>STOs are more of a hybrid between ICOs and IPOs. In an STO, the investor receives a token just as in an ICO, but the token represents some asset or security, whether stocks, bonds, or even a real estate asset. The three primary benefits of an STO over a traditional IPO are that (1) investors have access to a wider variety of assets through offerings (real estate investments, for example, are generally not available through an IPO), (2) a token holder gains all the benefits of blockchain technology including security, anonymity, transparency, smart contracts, near-instantaneous transactions, and more, and (3) investors have access to a plethora of information that the developer is legally required to provide. At the end of the day, raising capital for crypto is not all that different from raising capital for non-crypto ventures. </p>\n<h2 id=\"crypto-regulations\">Crypto Regulations</h2>\n<p>Crypto has experienced some major scandals that are inevitable without proper government regulation (Silk Road and Mt. Gox cases are good examples). As crypto expanded its user base, governments have taken notice and have begun to pass into law and enforce some important regulations. An overview of the crypto economy would not be complete without a discussion of regulation, but this topic is expansive enough to warrant its own article, as regulation will likely shape the direction of the crypto revolution in numerous ways. Thus, what follows is just a brief introduction to the most important issue you will encounter in this area, know-your-customer, or KYC, and anti-money laundering, or AML regulations. </p>\n<p>KYC and AML compliance require that crypto companies gather certain information about their clients to enable easier identification and tracking. These requirements serve to prevent criminal activity through the use of crypto, or, at the very least, make it more difficult not to get caught. One major benefit of crypto is that users can stay completely anonymous, showing the world only their wallet address in the form of a string of letters and numbers. This is great for legal actors who want to mask their transactions for benign reasons like privacy. However, criminals, especially money-laundering criminals like mobs and hackers, benefit in a major way from this anonymity. Requiring KYC information limits the risk of illegal activity through crypto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>The crypto economy is a dynamic and fast-paced system with groundbreaking innovation, the speed of which has never been seen in any economy in history. This innovation breeds flexibility, opportunity, and exciting new ways to solve old problems. This article hopefully provided the basic contours of the crypto economy, and equipped you with the knowledge necessary to do focused research on the areas of crypto that interest you most. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-03-17T13:24:54.159Z","createdAt":"2022-03-17T13:24:51.480Z","updatedAt":"2022-03-17T13:24:54.169Z"},{"id":1090,"title":"How to Stake Crypto?

Read our article to find out what staking is all about, so you can take advantage of this concept to earn rewards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-crypto-staking-mean\">What Does Crypto Staking Mean??</h2>\n<p>A short definition of staking states it is the process of holding coins for your mining pool. </p>\n<p>Staking is a process where users hold funds in their accounts to support a blockchain network. When you hold coins, you can receive rewards from your blockchain. Staking, therefore, allows users to earn rewards with their crypto holdings. It has become a popular way for investors to earn a passive income, due to the higher interest rates that it generates. The income earned through the rates being generated is sometimes even higher than you would earn with a savings account – making it a great alternative to traditional investments.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/02_17_Staking_101_1_01_a1320160c8.png\" alt=\"Staking Explained: All You Need to Know\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-crypto-staking-work\">How Does Crypto Staking Work?</h2>\n<p>Staking uses a proof-of-stake model, meaning that crypto users can lock in (or pledge) their coins for some time. The proof-of-stake consensus algorithm allows for a large number of transactions to be processed at a time and uses less cost per transaction than regular models. </p>\n<p>The staking period can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the type of cryptocurrency you are staking. Users cannot withdraw their coins or do any transactions during this period. If you do transact, you will lose out on your interest similar to traditional investments. </p>\n<p>Staking works through various cryptocurrency exchanges. You get to choose the amount you want to stake, although some cryptocurrencies may require you to stake a particular amount. However, you can pull out your stake if you change your mind (unstake your coins). You don’t “lose” your coins when you choose to unstake – they remain in your wallet and you can trade them as usual, later on.</p>\n<p>You can become a validator by pledging coins. A validator is someone who is chosen to verify transactions on a blockchain network. Although this is randomly chosen, the more coins you invest, the better chance you have of being chosen as a validator. </p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-staking-crypto\">Benefits of Staking Crypto</h2>\n<p>Staking serves as a great alternative to banking investments, with far less risk. </p>\n<p>The process uses a proof-to-take algorithm, using less energy than regular mining which uses a proof-of-work model.</p>\n<p>It’s an easy way to earn interest on your coins, with no equipment or tools needed. When you stake and become a validator, you help to ensure the security of the entire blockchain by </p>\n<p>supporting it as a whole. You can earn more than 20% interest in a year, depending on the crypto you are staking. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-stake-crypto\">How to Stake Crypto</h2>\n<p>Are you ready to stake? The process of staking can be overwhelming at first, but with time and practice, you can earn rewards easily. If you need help getting started, don’t panic, here’s an easy step-by-step guide to help you get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choose-a-cryptocurrency-to-stake\">Choose a cryptocurrency to stake</h3>\n<p>Look for a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and buy your <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies\">coins</a>. You can only stake with crypto that supports this model. It’s also possible to use a crypto trading platform to buy these coins. Before you choose a coin, it is recommended that you do your research to see which coin fits your budget and needs. Crypto can be unpredictable, but it’s a great long-term investment. Even if you choose not to use your coins for staking, they can be used to buy and sell assets. This means you need to choose a currency that is going to be worth your time and money.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t know which coin to invest in? Here’s a list to help you decide which crypto to choose:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ethereum has the highest crypto value after Bitcoin, making it a great investment. It’s affordable and is considered one of the most fluid liquid assets in crypto. Staking and Ethereum usually go hand-in-hand due to their popularity and lower inflation rates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/cardano\">Cardano</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cardano is more energy-efficient than most crypto. It’s also low-priced and a favorite with investors due to it being more programmable than Bitcoin. Staking investors use Cardano for its lower costs, making it popular and environmentally friendly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/polkadot\">Polkadot</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Polkadot works on multiple blockchains. It allows data and tokens to be transferred along with blockchains, making it a fast-growing crypto among investors. Polkadot is expected to do well as many high-end investors are now starting to invest in the coin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/solana\">Solana</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to its low fees, Solana is considered good crypto to invest in. It is the closest to Ethereum when it comes to speed and affordability. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/terra\">Terra</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Terra is a stablecoin that is cheap and allows for quick and easy transactions. Terra’s suite of stablecoins include US pegged TerraUSD (UST) and other coins pegged to the Euro, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tezos\">Tezos</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tezos is an environmental blockchain. It uses the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and is considered to be one of the most secure cryptos. Tezos has gained popularity due to the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFT) in gaming networks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choose-a-blockchain-wallet\">Choose a blockchain wallet</h3>\n<p>Once you buy your coins, you need to transfer them to a crypto or blockchain wallet. Depending on the platform you use, you can probably stake directly through the exchanges. In most cases, you will have to move your funds to a wallet. Crypto wallets help you to safely store your coins. Wallets are available to download, or you can use them on <a href=\"https://www.cryptowisser.com/8-best-crypto-affiliate-programs-in-2022\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">crypto affiliate programs</a> or platforms. </p>\n<p>Staking is simple using ChangeNOW’s NOW Wallet app. The NOW Wallet does not collect any data and you can store funds on your device safely and securely. NOW Wallet keeps adding new cryptocurrencies and NFTs to the range so you can stake using crypto of your choice. It&#39;s worth mentioning that the app supports staking of BEP2 NOW tokens. You can <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">download NOW Wallet</a>to your device for easy transactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deposit-your-coins\">Deposit your coins</h3>\n<p>Once you have your wallet, it’s time to deposit. You can choose which crypto you prefer and deposit your coins. You will then be provided with a wallet address.</p>\n<h3 id=\"find-a-crypto-staking-pool\">Find a crypto staking pool</h3>\n<p>After your funds are deposited, you can join a staking pool. A staking pool is a mining wallet where crypto traders combine their resources to earn better staking rewards. You need to do your research to decide which staking pool is best for you, and the crypto you want to stake. </p>\n<p><strong>Here are some tips when choosing a staking pool:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s best to choose a staking pool that has reasonable fees.</li>\n<li>Make sure there are no hidden fees.</li>\n<li>The staking pool should not crash and not be slow.</li>\n<li>Choose a pool that&#39;s not too small, as fewer investors can be risky.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start staking!</p>\n<p>Once you have found your pool, you are ready to stake it. Staking crypto can be done through your wallet. Simply choose the amount you want to stake to get started. You are now ready to earn rewards!</p>\n<h2 id=\"staking-tips\">Staking Tips</h2>\n<p><strong>Don’t be afraid to stake more if you have the funds available.</strong> If you aren’t going to use your crypto in the future, it is the best way to earn funds as it requires virtually no effort. </p>\n<p><strong>Do your research before you begin.</strong> Start by researching the different types of cryptos, as well as useful tips such as the ones provided in this article to help you make decisions. </p>\n<p><strong>Be patient.</strong> Staking is a long-term investment and as such, it requires time and patience on your part. Try not to pull out your stake unless you need the coins. The longer you stake, the better chance you have of earning a high reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Be careful of crypto projects with extremely high-interest rates.</strong> Sometimes this may be too good to be true, or it can be used as a tactic to get more investors on board. Staking rates can also quickly drop on these projects, which is why doing your research beforehand is essential.</p>\n<p><strong>Choose the exchange you are going to use for staking carefully.</strong> Most exchanges are going to make a commission off your stake, so choose the commission that works for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"should-you-choose-to-stake\">Should You Choose to Stake?</h2>\n<p>Staking is a trend that is here to stay. Today, staking is offered through many exchanges and cryptocurrencies. As rewards become available, more people are choosing to stake to earn a passive income. Investors around the world, as well as financial and retail institutions, will likely join in on the staking trend and find ways to work with crypto holders. </p>\n<p>Choosing to stake puts you ahead of the pack. You can earn rewards without doing much, and you can earn more interest per year than traditional investors. Although market rates may vary, it is essential to choose the crypto that works for you. Do your research before you stake to guarantee that you make a profit. As with all investments, staking takes time. If you have patience, the funds, and the discipline to earn rewards through long-term crypto investments, staking is a good investment. Like crypto trading, you should learn as much as you can about staking before you jump in. You can also use risk management to help you decide how far you are willing to go, and where to stop. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}},{"id":4,"name":"Industry","description":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more. \n\n","slug":"industry","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Industry - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more.

The <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/eos\">EOS</a> cryptocurrency has the biggest chance of displacing Ethereum from its leading position on the dApp market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-eos-crypto\">What is EOS Crypto?</h2>\n<p>EOS is a platform for developing decentralized applications, the main competitor to Ethereum. It is often called Ethereum-on-steroids due to its very high (up to 10,000 TPS) transaction processing speed. The network supports smart contracts and dApps just like Ethereum, but it does not suffer from problems with scaling and speed of work. </p>\n<p>EOS is also the name of the project&#39;s native utility token. The task of the coin is to distribute functional roles between its holders, as well as to implement the voting function and thus participate in the indirect management of the blockchain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/EOS_0917bdf4fc.png\" alt=\"EOS Explained\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"history-of-eos\">History of EOS</h2>\n<p>EOS is developed by Block.one, a company registered in the Cayman Islands. The idea of the project belongs to  Daniel Larimer, a programmer who is also known to the crypto community as a co-founder of the BitShares DEX exchange and the decentralized social network Steemit.</p>\n<p>The company conducted an ICO campaign to fund the development of the project. Initially, the platform was launched on the Ethereum blockchain; but the developers worked hard on their own network. The EOS Dawn 1.0 testnet was launched on September 3, 2017. The second version of the testnet was released on December 4th. Dawn 3.0 and 4.0 were brought out on January 25 and May 7, 2018, respectively. In June 2018, after an active phase of development and testing, the mainnet EOSIO was launched. These manipulations allowed the EOS cryptocurrency to finally migrate to its own blockchain. </p>\n<h2 id=\"eos-main-features\">EOS main features</h2>\n<p>EOS turned out to be a rather interesting cryptocurrency. It outperforms its main competitor <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> on several levels but has certain flaws. Here are the EOS platform’s main advantages.</p>\n<p><strong>Low level of inflation</strong></p>\n<p>The supply of the coin is unlimited and issued to reward block producers. Previously, EOS had a 5% inflation rate which was lowered to 1% after a majority of the community voted to decrease it.</p>\n<p><strong>High level of scalability</strong></p>\n<p>The EOS network uses a consensus algorithm called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). EOS developers claim that EOS can currently process more than 10,000 transactions per second. Theoretically, the team can achieve one million TPS, integrating inter-blockchain communication (IBC) into the network’s architecture.</p>\n<p><strong>Free transactions for users</strong></p>\n<p>Transactions are free for end users of dApps , but not for developers. The latter decide for themselves how to monetize their applications to cover the costs of using the network. The only requirement for utilizing the EOS blockchain is a sufficient amount of resources – RAM, NET, and CPU. The more transactions you do, the more resources you need to process transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>User-friendly tools for developers</strong></p>\n<p>EOS provides an extensive set of tools and a web platform for developers. The platform allows you to stop and fix a broken application, use ready-made templates to create interfaces and client databases. EOS devs can code on a variety of programming languages with a compiler that converts the code to web assembly.</p>\n<p><strong>Free access to basic features for developers</strong></p>\n<p>If you wish to launch a blockchain ecosystem or a decentralized application on the EOS platform, the main components are available for free.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eos-dpos-algorithm\">EOS DPoS algorithm</h2>\n<p>EOS works on the Delegated Proof of Stake algorithm. It means that users are divided into many voters and 21 block producers, who maintain the network, validate transactions, and get a reward for that. After each voting session, the top 21 validators are chosen to confirm 252 blocks for one round and then the process repeats itself.</p>\n<p>To become a validator, a network participant must fulfill two conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have sufficient technical capacity to provide a 24/7 operation of the network to verify transactions and produce new blocks.</li>\n<li>Maintain an impeccable reputation and spend resources on building a community and getting the necessary user votes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to vote for a validator you need to stake your coins - hold EOS on your balance. The amount of EOS staked is also your voting power. The higher you stake, the more weight your vote has.</p>\n<h2 id=\"net-cpu-and-ram\">NET, CPU, and RAM</h2>\n<p>The way EOS works is similar to that of an operating system. There are 3 types of resources: CPU, RAM, and NET. Each of them plays a significant role on the network. CPU and NET are resources required to perform actions on the EOS blockchain. </p>\n<p>CPU is used every time you perform any transaction with your EOS account. It is measured in microseconds, and its role is to process your EOS transaction. NET is the least important resource. It is measured in kilobytes and increases network traffic, which means you can send more transactions from your account. In most cases, you won&#39;t need a lot of NET. To use CPU and NET you have to stake some of your EOS coins. Usually, it is enough to stake only 1 or 2 EOS for a common user.</p>\n<p>RAM is an important resource for developers. They have to purchase it with EOS to run their apps. RAM serves to temporarily store data that is actively used in the applications. So if you are a dApp developer, you have to purchase RAM.</p>\n<h2 id=\"criticism-of-eos\">Criticism of EOS</h2>\n<p>The DPoS algorithm sounds good in theory, but in practice it turns out to be more complicated. The main argument of critics is the tendency of the network towards centralization due to the small number of nodes.</p>\n<p>Only 21 users can create a block in EOS at a time, while there are almost ten thousand of them in Ethereum. Besides, there have already been several cases of canceling confirmed transactions, which is a direct violation of the principle of decentralization.</p>\n<p>Etherscan data shows that 75% of all EOS coins are stored on the top 100 addresses on the EOS network. It means that too many coins are concentrated in the hands of few people. Thus, they have an exaggerated influence on voting and management of the network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Despite the fears of centralization and complex governance mechanisms, EOS is actively developing.

It’s these two qualities that make the technology unlike anything to exist before it, as well as being potentially revolutionary.</p>\n<p>However, when blockchains are optimised for such security and decentralization, adding new data takes a long time. By contrast, blockchains optimised for speed allow new blocks of data to be added much faster. So far, however, this increased performance always comes at the cost of decentralization and/or security. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin coined the phrase “blockchain trilemma” to describe these trade-offs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Scaling_fdaee91e9a.png\" alt=\"Blockchain Scaling Explained\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"existing-efforts-to-scale-blockchains\">Existing Efforts to Scale Blockchains</h2>\n<p>Scaling blockchains effectively is all about increasing the total number of users that can use a network without compromising on the potentially world-changing qualities of the underlying blockchain technology. Different cryptocurrency networks approach the scaling issue in different ways. Thus far, however, none have succeeded in creating a blockchain that can serve the masses while still retaining both immaculate security and decentralisation.</p>\n<p>Efforts to increase the performance of blockchain networks fall into two broad categories – on-chain scaling and off-chain scaling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"on-chain-scaling\">On-Chain Scaling</h2>\n<p>Also known as layer one or base layer scaling, on-chain scaling is all about changing elements of the blockchain itself to allow larger amounts of data to be stored in less time. Cryptocurrencies like <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin-cash\">Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/litecoin\">Litecoin (LTC)</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ripple\">XRP</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/eos\">EOS</a>, and many others all attempt to solve the scalability issue at the base layer. So too do efforts like Bitcoin’s SegWit.</p>\n<p>Different attempts to scale blockchains at the base layer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing the maximum size each block of transactions can be. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) are both cryptocurrencies that attempt to scale using larger blocks.</li>\n<li>Decreasing the time between adding new blocks to the chain. Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many other post-Bitcoin blockchains have shorter block times than BTC.</li>\n<li>Reducing the memory demands of transactions. The scaling upgrade added to Bitcoin (BTC) known as SegWit reduced the amount of transaction data that needed recording to the blockchain to allow more transactions to be added in every block.</li>\n<li>Changing the consensus mechanism. Different consensus mechanisms provide different trade-offs between speed, decentralization, and security. </li>\n<li>Redesigning the blockchain’s structure entirely. An example of this is sharding, which breaks up the blockchain into smaller pieces with different groups of nodes assigned to each partition. Ethereum 2.0 incorporated sharding, and many are optimistic that it will, in theory, allow the network to scale dramatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although each of the above methods does indeed allow blockchains to process and confirm a greater number of transactions per second and, therefore, serve a larger user base, they all have their downsides. </p>\n<p>The drawbacks of some methods, like increasing the block size, are easy to understand. Larger blocks demand more powerful and increasingly expensive hardware. This limits the number of people that can afford to run the equipment needed to secure the network.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, efforts like SegWit, for example, might not introduce centralization or security risks but their impact on speed and total transactions per second possible are negligible. Even with 100% of Bitcoin users transacting to and from SegWit addresses, the increase in network capacity is fairly small. Bitcoin is still not challenging the likes of completely centralized payment networks like Visa or even cryptocurrency networks that have compromised on security and decentralization to achieve a high transaction per second count.  </p>\n<p>Since they’re still very much works in progress, efforts like sharding introduce a variety of other issues. By dramatically increasing the complexity of the blockchain itself, new vulnerabilities and attack vectors are introduced. That’s why those developing Ethereum 2.0 are moving so slowly and still only expect sharding to become a feature in a few years’ time.</p>\n<p>Finally, the use of alternate consensus mechanisms, like those of EOS or XRP, often limit the number of transaction validators. With a smaller group of validators, the cost of attacking a network significantly reduces. In fact, a coordinated effort by governments could likely shut down such cryptocurrencies if they ever became large enough to threaten national currencies, which many users hope they will.</p>\n<h2 id=\"off-chain-scaling\">Off-Chain Scaling</h2>\n<p>Clearly, scaling blockchains at the base layer isn’t easy. Every proposed solution has its own limitations or forces a compromise in terms of either decentralization or overall security. For this reason, blockchain developers are working on ways to allow more users to transact on a network without altering a blockchain’s fundamental structure. Such efforts to solve the issue of blockchain scaling are known as off-chain scaling solutions.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin’s main value propositions are its scarcity, immutability, permissionless nature, and censorship resistance. These characteristics are protected by the security afforded by the world’s most powerful computer network. Such assurances of consistency have encouraged millions of retail investors, a growing list of institutions, and corporate treasurers like those at Microstrategy, Square, and other publicly-listed companies to trust the network as a store of value for hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Understandably, Bitcoin developers aren’t willing to make any compromises on either decentralization or security. That’s why most discussions surrounding scaling solutions for Bitcoin focus on off-chain scaling.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Ethereum is host to a growing number of decentralized financial applications. This has seen its usage exceed the network’s capacity in recent months. When there are more transactions than there is block space, both transaction fees and confirmation waiting times rise. This limits the utility of networks, meaning that only the wealthiest can afford to transact. </p>\n<p>As mentioned, Ethereum has its own grand plan to scale its base layer. However, due to the complexity of sharding and other features of Ethereum 2.0, the upgrade is going to take a few years to complete. Hence, Ethereum developers are also exploring off-chain scaling solutions to reduce demand for block space.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, off-chain scaling involves conducting transactions away from the blockchain itself. By moving some transactions off the blockchain, demand for block space is reduced. Certain types of transactions are better suited to on-chain settlement. These include high value transactions that demand the utmost security. Meanwhile, other transactions probably don’t need the security of thousands of specialised computer systems. The example of buying a cup of coffee using Bitcoin fits into this category.</p>\n<h2 id=\"different-approaches-to-off-chain-scaling\">Different Approaches to Off-Chain Scaling</h2>\n<p>Although full explanations of the various off-chain scaling protocols is beyond the scope of this introduction to scaling, we’ve listed some of the more prominent ones below. We’ve also included the network they’re being developed for and a brief description of them: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightning Network (Bitcoin) – Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is a transaction protocol that uses payment channels to facilitate incredibly fast payments of any size at a fraction of the cost of an onchain transaction.  </li>\n<li>Rollups (Ethereum) – groups of transactions put together off-chain within a smart contract. There are different varieties of Rollups including Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups. </li>\n<li>Sidechains (Ethereum and Bitcoin) – Independent blockchains connected to a parent chain with a two-way peg. Examples include Blockstream’s Liquid Network (Bitcoin) and Skale (Ethereum)</li>\n<li>Plasma (Ethereum) – a framework of secondary blockchains that only occasionally interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Each “child chain”, as they’re called, can be optimised for different use cases. Plasma chains are a bit like sidechains, only they sacrifice some functionality for additional security.</li>\n<li>State channels (Ethereum) – a way of performing valid Ethereum transactions and other processes away from the blockchain. They’re kept secure by having the option to refer back to the main chain if they ever need to.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"scaling-blockchains-no-easy-solution\">Scaling Blockchains: No Easy Solution!</h2>\n<p>As you can see from the sheer number of different potential scaling solutions proposed to date, increasing a blockchain’s overall capacity, and therefore utility, isn’t exactly simple. However, it’s also clear from the amount of development work going into scaling that it’s one of the biggest challenges facing the industry.</p>\n<p>Although many newer blockchain-based cryptocurrencies claim to have found a solution to the problem, thus far, they all rely on making changes to the underlying blockchain. While these changes can result in radically faster transactions for the networks in question, they also reduce a blockchain’s overall security or increase centralization. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, it’s up to the users themselves if speed of transactions is more important to them than decentralization and security. It’s, therefore, telling that the two networks that seem to take both decentralization and security the most seriously have the largest market capitalizations in the industry. Put simply, it’s not all about which blockchain can process the most number of transactions per second. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2022-01-27T14:08:30.366Z","createdAt":"2022-01-26T20:59:28.903Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-27T14:08:30.376Z"},{"id":979,"title":"How Do Cryptocurrency Wallets Work?

A crypto wallet is more versatile because it can house your crypto either in a physical location or a virtual location. The key difference between crypto wallets and traditional wallets is that crypto wallets are generally extremely secure, employing several different security measures to keep your crypto safe. There is also a large variety of different types of crypto wallets, from hot wallets, to cold wallets, to multi-wallets, and more. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-a-crypto-wallet-work\">How Does a Crypto Wallet Work?</h2>\n<p>A crypto wallet works by providing the holder of funds with both a public and private key. The public key is what the blockchain ledger (and the entire crypto public) sees when you transact with your crypto. The private key is a cryptographically generated set of numbers and letters that functions as a password for accessing your wallet. The most basic method of authorization is just a password. You can access most wallets by simply entering your username or public key and inputting your password or pin number. There are an array of measures available for increasing wallet security, but it is helpful to first have a sense of the different types of wallets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Crypto_wallets_2_Montazhnaya_oblast_1_3ba40a58ea.png\" alt=\"Crypto Wallets and Asset Security\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"different-types-of-crypto-wallets\">Different Types of Crypto Wallets</h2>\n<h3 id=\"hot-and-cold-crypto-wallets\">Hot and Cold Crypto Wallets</h3>\n<p>The first exposure many people will have to a crypto wallet is the hot wallets used by exchanges. These wallets are great for liquidity and ease of transactions, allowing for the quick exchange of tokens. A hot wallet is just any wallet that is connected to the internet. On that note, there are also web wallets, which exist solely online. Web wallets are essentially the email version of crypto wallets. The downside to hot and web wallets is that, while they are very secure, they are more susceptible to hacking. A cold wallet, on the other hand, is stored offline — you do not have to be connected to the internet to access your wallet. Most people access their cold wallet on mobile or desktop apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hardware-cryptocurency-wallets\">Hardware Cryptocurency Wallets</h3>\n<p>Hot and cold wallets generally have straightforward functionality and basic cryptographic security. Aside from these more basic types of wallets, there are some more niche sorts of wallets. While hot and cold wallets are software wallets, a hard wallet is a small, physical plug-in wallet for storing your crypto — a hardware wallet. Hard wallets have increased security because they are not stored on a computer or desktop, so hacking them is nearly impossible. Hard wallets are entirely portable, and usually less than half the size of a smartphone. The most common type of hard wallet is the Ledger Nano wallet, with its sleek design and increased functionality. Ledger wallets even enable staking for tokens that support it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-wallets\">Multi-Wallets</h3>\n<p>The wallets mentioned so far are typically used to store only one type of token. Multi-wallets are capable of supporting hundreds or thousands of different crypto tokens. If you want to store all of your crypto in one place, and only have to remember one password, then multi-wallets are ideal. The most common mult-wallets, like Atomic Wallet, are simply cold wallets, but there are many hard wallets that function as multi-wallets as well. </p>\n<h3 id=\"paper-wallets\">Paper Wallets</h3>\n<p>One more type of wallet to mention is a paper wallet, though it is not very popular nowadays due to the variety of better options. A paper wallet is just a cold wallet that forces the user to physically print out their public and private keys onto a piece of paper. The idea behind paper wallets is that your keys are not stored on any hackable device, instead being committed to a piece of paper you should keep safe in the physical world. The problem with paper wallets is that the paper with your keys is very easy to lose and very easy to steal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/infographic_2_53dfb28a49.jpg\" alt=\"infographic-2.jpg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"authorization-and-security\">Authorization And Security</h2>\n<p>There are a host of methods for authorization used to increase wallet security. A traditional money wallet requires only that somebody be holding the wallet. Thankfully, it is more difficult to obtain authorization and access to crypto funds. As noted above, the most basic method of authorization is just a password or pin number. You can access most hot wallets and cold wallets by simply entering your password into the prompt.</p>\n<p>However, many wallets support increased security and authorization measures. Most exchange wallets, for example, offer two-factor authentication before depositing or withdrawing funds from the exchange. A security feature that has become increasingly popular is multisignature technology. With multisig, a crypto owner can require a certain number of private keys to access their wallet. Most often, the owner of the wallet will require two private keys in a set of three keys. This security option enables you to store different keys in different places, mitigating the risk of losing your private key. It also frustrates any hacker that gains access to only one of your private keys.</p>\n<p>As alluded to above, hard wallets increase security simply by obviating the need for access to a computer or mobile phone. Computers and phones are hacked every single day through a phishing email, malicious website, or dangerous software downloads. A hard wallet protects your crypto by focusing solely on your funds. It does nothing more than store your tokens; there is no possibility for hackers to gain access to it. Hard wallets are entirely portable, so you can keep them with you at all times, or store them in a safe or safe deposit box for maximum security. To authorize your funds, simply plug your hard wallet into a device and enter your password. When you are finished checking your balance or transacting, simply unplug the wallet and store it away for safekeeping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Crypto wallets offer optimum security and increased functionality, but at their core, these wallets are simply vehicles for storing your funds and interacting with the blockchain network. For those who are focused on security, hard wallets are ideal. Exchange hot wallets, web wallets, and offline cold wallets should provide sufficient functionality for those whose primary goal is liquidity and quick transactions. As the burgeoning crypto industry continues to grow, newer and safer wallets will invariably pop up, so always be on the lookout for the next innovation in crypto storage. </p>\n<p>A great option for storing your crypto assets is <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a> – a non-custodial digital wallet designed by and for crypto enthusiasts.

The following year he organized a crowd sale to fund the development of ETH. In 2015, the very first block of data appeared on the network thus launching the Ethereum platform.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-basics\">Ethereum Basics</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Ethereum_2_418edfc9a3.png\" alt=\"Ethereum: Basics, ETH 2.0, and Forks Explained\" ></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> is a software platform based on blockchain tech. It allows developers to create decentralized applications also known as dApps. The founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, calls his creation a “World Computer”. It doesn’t operate on one device but runs simultaneously on thousands of computers around the world.</p>\n<p>The internal currency of the platform is also called Ethereum, Ether, or ETH. It is used to maintain the blockchain and execute smart contracts and plays a role of fuel on the network. Also, it is a digital currency, like BTC and other crypto coins.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible Ethereum platform use cases:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create smart contracts for the supply chain management.</li>\n<li>Run applications and games. </li>\n<li>Create services for document authentication, etc.</li>\n<li>Develop a decentralized asset exchange. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ethereum can be described as a huge computer that allows devs to build programs. In fact, the Ethereum team has developed Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that allows running code with smart contracts.</p>\n<p>Smart contracts are programs that automatically execute certain agreements within the blockchain. Smart contracts are built in such a way that the execution of the code occurs only when certain conditions are reached.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart contracts have the following advantages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital information. No need to print or publish documents, it is easy to distribute.</li>\n<li>Autonomy. No intermediaries or hesitation in decision-making.</li>\n<li>Reliability. Information in a smart contract is encrypted and stored in a centralized registry.</li>\n<li>Security. Encryption makes it nearly impossible to steal information from a contract.</li>\n<li>Speed. Automatic execution makes smart contracts faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-fees\">Ethereum Fees</h2>\n<p>Ethereum blockchain is not free to use. To run a smart contract, you have to pay a fee in Gas – a small piece of Ether (ETH). It is a kind of digital fuel that facilitates transaction processing and maintains network security. Gas is a unit used to calculate ETH fees and usually ranges from several dozens to several hundreds of Gwei (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei). It is dynamic and increases when the network is overloaded and decreases when there is less competition for resources.</p>\n<p>A transaction fee on the Ethereum network will be calculated using the following formula:</p>\n<p><em>Amount of Gas required * cost of 1 Gas = transaction fee</em></p>\n<p>One of the network’s principles is the more gas you pay, the faster the network processes a transaction. Usually, the Ethereum blockchain requires 21000 Gas, or around 0.002 ETH at the moment of writing to process a simple transaction. But when it comes to a smart contract of an application, the fee can be much higher. Another drawback is that the growth of the ETH to USD rate can amp up the transaction price.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-vs-bitcoin\">Ethereum vs Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>ETH has several advantages over Bitcoin. Its issuance is not limited like in BTC. As for the Ethereum mining algorithm, ETH uses the Ethash method. As a result, the block processing speed is faster.</p>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n   <td>Ethereum\n   </td>\n   <td>Bitcoin\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Launch Date\n   </td>\n   <td>2015\n   </td>\n   <td>2009\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Consensus Algorithm\n   </td>\n   <td>PoW, PoS in 2020 - 2021\n   </td>\n   <td>PoW\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Mining Algorithm\n   </td>\n   <td>Ethash\n   </td>\n   <td>Double SHA-256\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Maximum Supply\n   </td>\n   <td>Unlimited\n   </td>\n   <td>21 mln. \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Avg Block Time\n   </td>\n   <td>15 seconds\n   </td>\n   <td>10 minutes\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Current Block Reward\n   </td>\n   <td>2 ETH\n   </td>\n   <td>6.25 BTC\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Main purpose\n   </td>\n   <td>Platform for dApps and smart contracts\n   </td>\n   <td>Digital currency / Payment processor\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p>However, the main advantage of Ethereum over Bitcoin is functionality. Bitcoin can only register transactions. The capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain cover numerous spheres from document flow processing to financial services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-and-the-boom-of-icos\">Ethereum and the Boom of ICOs</h2>\n<p>The Ethereum network has laid the foundation for many other crypto coins. Back in the day, ETH was the main platform for the creation of other cryptocurrencies running Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). </p>\n<p>The boom of ICOs happened in 2016-2017, when almost every token sale succeeded. Here are a few popular ICOs and how much funds they raised:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EOS – USD 185 million in 5 days</li>\n<li>NEO – first round: USD 550000, second round: USD 4.5 million</li>\n<li>Stratis – USD 675000 in 5 weeks</li>\n<li>IOTA – USD 400000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ICO market was flooded with scams and fake projects. As a result, the interest of investors decreased by 2018. Most crypto projects couldn’t reach even the minimum amount required for the development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dapps-on-ethereum\">Dapps on Ethereum</h2>\n<p>Dapps are applications based on blockchain technology. They differ significantly from other types of software, like Windows or Mac OS. These apps don’t have a centralized server and operate by interacting with the blockchain. Decentralization makes these apps more difficult to hack and provides more transparency for financial services. Given the decentralized nature of these applications and blockchain data protection mechanisms, dApps potentially have many different use cases, from gambling to financial applications. </p>\n<p><strong>Here are some of the most interesting dApps found on Ethereum:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CryptoKitties – a collectible game where players breed, trade, and collect virtual cats with unique features and characteristics.</li>\n<li>Augur – an open-source decentralized marketplace for predicting various events. The project was supported by Vitalik Buterin.</li>\n<li>Idex – decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, where users can trade different crypto assets.</li>\n<li>Compound Finance – a protocol that allows you to borrow and lend out cryptocurrency assets without intermediaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Infographic_2_6a88506468.jpg\" alt=\"Infographic (2).jpg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-20\">Ethereum 2.0</h2>\n<p>Despite having a faster network than BTC, Ethereum’s transaction speed is still far from perfect. Currently, ETH blockchain can process 15 transactions per second (TPS), which slows down massive adoption of the network. Thus, the team decided to increase the network capacity to 100,000 TPS with a significant upgrade – Ethereum 2.0. Ethereum 2.0, also referred to as Eth 2.0 or Serenity, has been in the works for a long time. Its various phases are aimed at not only improving the network’s speed, but also increasing its scalability, and security.</p>\n<p>The new version of the network includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharding. The entire ETH network consists of multiple parts called shards. Each shard contains its own independent state, or a unique set of account balances and smart contracts.</li>\n<li>Plasma. It is a solution that enables the creation of subsidiary blockchains interacting with the mainchain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ETH 2.0 Rollout Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The update to the network includes a 3-phase rollout, the first of which is called the Beacon chain also known as Phase 0. While the Beacon chain’s release date was originally set for 2019, it was finally launched on December 1, 2020. With the Beacon chain, native staking was brought onboard the Ethereum blockchain. Although at the moment, the Beacon chain is distinct from the Ethereum blockchain it will play a pivotal part in the network’s shift to PoS consensus.</p>\n<p>The second phase, dubbed The Merge, involves, as the name denotes, merging the Beacon chain with the Ethereum main-net. With its launch, scheduled sometime within the first half of 2022, staking will become possible throughout the network. It will simultaneously mark the end of Ethereum’s implementation of the PoW consensus mechanism. </p>\n<p>The final phase before Serenity is the release of shard chains. Phase 2 is aimed at increasing the network’s capacity to process transactions and retain data by introducing sharding. This entails distributing operations across 64 new chains rather than running it all on a single chain. </p>\n<p>Ethereum’s big upgrade will see its algorithm changed to a more accessible, faster, and sustainable Proof of Stake. PoS is a consensus algorithm where validators (miners) stake a part of their coins to get the right to mine the next block and validate transactions. The bigger their stake, the bigger is the reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum 2.0 gives miners two options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become a solo validator – stake no less than 32 ETH.</li>\n<li>Become a pool validator – stake less than 32 ETH and share a reward with the pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the activity and smart contracts continue to operate on the original Ethereum network, which runs in parallel with ETH 2.0. The developers can move their apps to an upgraded version of the network but not vice versa. </p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-hard-forks\">Ethereum Hard Forks</h2>\n<p>Apart from the 3 major phases, the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap has other changes of varying degrees lined up for the network, which include hard forks. A hard fork occurs when major upgrades are made resulting in a temporary or permanent blockchain split. Hard forks could be planned or the chain could divide into 2 possible paths when an agreement cannot be reached.</p>\n<p>Hard forks are rather radical changes to a blockchain as once they happen, older versions of the blockchain are rendered obsolete. Ethereum has undergone <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/ethereum-forks-the-lowdown-on-london-and-whats-to-come\">several</a> hard forks, the most significant being the DAO fork which occurred following the infamous DAO attack in 2016. </p>\n<p>After 3.6 million ETH was stolen through a faulty contract, the Ethereum community voted on the next step. About 85% of the voters opted to fork and the minority that chose not to went on to establish Ethereum Classic.</p>\n<p>Since Phase 0 of the Serenity rollout went live, 3 hard forks have occurred with 1 more still intended for launch in 2021.</p>\n<p>The first was the Berlin hard fork. This was implemented on April 15, 2021, and comprised 4 Ethereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs. EIPs can be brought forward by anyone in the ETH community and these were designed to adjust the gas costs and introduce new transactions. </p>\n<p>These proposals are:</p>\n<p>EIP-2565 which uses an algorithm to lower the fees for a particular set of transactions.</p>\n<p>EIP-2929; with this proposal, the gas fees for “opcode” transactions were increased. EIP-2929 resolved the problem with denial of service attacks Ethereum had experienced in the past due to those transactions.</p>\n<p>EIP-2718 adds a new transaction type to the network named “envelope transactions.” Using envelope transactions, all other types of transactions are made backward compatible.</p>\n<p>EIP-2930; Based on EIP-2718 this proposal introduces a type of transaction that enables users on the network to design future templates for complex transactions to reduce gas prices and aid processing.</p>\n<p>The Berlin hard fork set the stage for the London hard fork which was released on August 4 this year and contained 5 proposals. All 5 EIPs were deliberately chosen to tackle specific problems in the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p><strong>Significant EIPs</strong></p>\n<p>The most significant EIPs of the London hard fork were EIP-1559 and EIP-3554. The first restructured the fee system by enabling users to set transaction costs by choosing 3 bid options provided for ETH transactions. It was predicted that EIP-1559 would drastically lower the inflation of fees alongside introducing a base fee.</p>\n<p>Another major feature of EIP-1559 is that it reduces the number of ether coins in circulation thus making Ethereum into a deflationary asset, allowing its purchasing ability to increase as time goes on.</p>\n<p>EIP-3554 dubbed “The Difficulty Bomb Delay” put the ETH mining difficulty on hold till December. Once the difficulty bomb is launched PoW mining will be inoperative thus smoothing the switch to PoS by making mining less attractive to ETH miners.</p>\n<p>After the London upgrade went live, the Ethereum blockchain recorded a 9% rise in chain capacity. The Difficulty Bomb is however not expected to launch soon, after Ethereum <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/10/arrow-glacier-announcement/\">revealed</a> another update will push back implementation of the Bomb Delay by several months.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Forks</strong></p>\n<p>The third and most recent hard fork undergone by the Ethereum network is the Altair upgrade. Altair is a huge step towards introducing PoS to the entire network, the first update to the Beacon Chain since it was released in December last year. Altair brings the proof of stake system to Beacon before it merges with the Ethereum main net in 2022.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Altair also brings 2 key features to Ethereum; support for “light clients,” like mobile phones for transaction verification which promotes decentralization. The other new feature was raising penalties for inoperative nodes. Stakers who have to put down a minimum of 32 ETH towards the PoS system need to remain active or their stake will be cut down.</p>\n<p>The next hard fork, Arrow Glacier is <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/10/arrow-glacier-announcement/\">due</a> today. Once the upgrade is launched by Wednesday, December 8 this year, it will delay the Ice Age difficulty bomb for several months.</p>\n<p>As the difficulty bomb will only disturb PoW networks, the decision was made to put it on hold until June and test out the transition to PoS on the Ropsten network.</p>\n<p>Once Serenity is fully implemented several changes will be brought onto the Ethereum network. From making ETH more eco-friendly to improving scalability and security. There’s a long way to go but until then the PoW system carries on.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}},{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy","coins"],"publishedAt":"2021-12-10T11:58:56.534Z","createdAt":"2021-12-10T11:58:07.790Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-05T15:51:33.015Z"},{"id":881,"title":"Cryptocurrency Exchange Fees Explained","description":"In each cryptocurrency exchange, there are specific fees that a trader needs to pay to validate the trade.

To make the process as easy as possible for our customers, we will explain what expenses are embodied in a typical crypto swap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Cryptocurrency_Exchange_Fees_Explained_363a7c97e7.jpg\" alt=\"Cryptocurrency Exchange Fees Explained: What Happens During a Crypto Swap?\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-swaps-work\">How Do Swaps Work?</h2>\n<p>The process of exchanging cryptocurrencies is a complex one. It involves moving coins between different providers and paying several fees and commissions for such transactions. The users are not aware of this because everything is being handled in the background. Let’s talk about those hidden processes and explain how an instant crypto swap works.</p>\n<p>When you initiate a trade on a crypto swap platform, it automatically looks for the best market exchange rates to offer you the greatest value for your money. Swapping cryptocurrencies requires several steps. During each stage, a small fee is charged. </p>\n<p>These are the fees that you need to be aware of when exchanging digital assets through a crypto swap platform: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The network fees when sending funds to the site’s deposit address. This includes the mining fees to incorporate your transaction in a block or the withdrawal fees if you send coins from a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party exchange.</li>\n<li>The network fees that liquidity providers charge for transferring coins to them.</li>\n<li>The crypto trading fees liquidity providers charge to swap one asset for another one.</li>\n<li>The network fees that are required to send the assets back to you from the 3<sup>rd</sup>-party service providers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"deposit-fees\">Deposit Fees</h2>\n<p>Every deposit to a crypto swap platform includes a mandatory transaction fee that the sender must pay. This is a blockchain safety mechanism implemented to prevent fraudulent individuals from spamming the network. </p>\n<p>If we are talking about <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> transactions, the fee depends on the current blockchain congestion, the type of addresses for sending and receiving coins, and the number of inputs and outputs.</p>\n<p>When there is a lot of traffic, miners will prioritize the transactions that pay higher network fees. Those paying less are pushed back and required to wait their time. To prevent this from happening to you, ensure that your depositing transaction includes a high enough miner fee. For more information on how a cryptocurrency transaction gets confirmed, please have a look at <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/how-crypto-transactions-are-confirmed\">this detailed article</a>.  </p>\n<p>An excellent way to save some money is to use Native Segwit addresses (Bech-32) when sending and receiving Bitcoin. They will allow you to save up to 60% in mining fees. However, the number of inputs and outputs significantly affects the total blockchain fees. A higher number of inputs/outputs results in a bigger size and weight of the transaction. Preferably, your depositing transaction should have only one input and one output to and from Native Segwit addresses.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"3rd-party-network-fees\">3rd-Party Network Fees</h2>\n<p>Crypto swap platforms have partnerships with various liquidity providers that help in the exchange process. Let’s take any two popular cryptocurrencies, for example, Cardano and Polkadot. You will quickly notice that there isn’t a trading pair on traditional exchanges that will allow you to swap Cardano for Polkadot directly. What you have to do instead is exchange Cardano for a stablecoin or a more popular currency like ETH or BTC, for example, and then use one of those assets and trade it for Polkadot.</p>\n<p>That process involves different blockchain interactions and multiple trading and network fees. It takes a long time and costs plenty of money. Moreover, you can’t know what effect the volatility of cryptocurrencies will have on the prices in the meantime.</p>\n<p>When a user deposits a coin to a swap platform, the asset is transferred to a unique generated address. This way the exchange knows which specific user sent them these specific funds, as the blockchain is private. To swap the funds, the platform transfers them to the liquidity provider. This operation happens on-chain and requires a deposit network fee. When the swap is completed, the funds go from the liquidity provider to the user. It also happens on-chain and requires a withdrawal network fee. </p>\n<p>This is where instant crypto swap services come into play. They will tackle this problem effortlessly, perform each trade in the background, charge you the total fee, and deliver only the final product – the currency you wanted. Swap platforms offer you a quick and easy way to exchange any two assets you want. You only pay the fees once, and you don’t have to search various exchanges looking for the trading pairs you need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3rd-party-crypto-trading-fees\">3rd-Party Crypto Trading Fees</h2>\n<p>Each trade on cryptocurrency exchanges requires the trader to pay a fee whenever a coin is purchased or sold. This fee is known as the trading fee. The commission amounts depend on several factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How big the transaction is.</li>\n<li>How frequently you trade.</li>\n<li>If you are creating maker or taker orders. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges incentivize traders to trade frequently and in large quantities. Therefore, if you use their services a lot, they will offer you more cost-efficient fees. The opposite happens when you trade in smaller amounts and infrequently. Thus, percentage-wise, you will pay less for a $50.000 exchange than for a $50 one. </p>\n<p>Depending on the type of buy or sell order you create on an exchange, you will be asked to pay either a <em>“maker”</em> or <em>“taker”</em> fee. If you make additional liquidity available to the site, you will pay maker fees. If you take away or remove liquidity, you will be subjected to taker fees.</p>\n<p>Maker fees are paid by traders whose orders are not filled immediately. Instead, they increase the platform’s overall liquidity. For example, the buy or sell order will only get filled if the price of the asset increases or decreases to the value the order is set at. Taker fees are paid by traders whose orders are immediately filled from the liquidity available at the exchange.</p>\n<p>Let’s show you this with a practical example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you place a sell order for 1 Bitcoin at $63.000 when the asset’s value is $62.000, you are creating a market and adding liquidity to it. Your order won’t be filled until Bitcoin’s price increases, and at that time, you will pay maker fees.</li>\n<li>Contrary to that, if your sell order is at $62.000, it will be filled straight away, and you will remove liquidity from the exchange. Because of that, you have to pay taker fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s in the interest of cryptocurrency exchanges to keep the liquidity on their platforms as high as possible. As a result, taker fees are always higher than maker fees. When you use instant crypto swap platforms, you want the exchange to be completed as soon as possible. As you have hopefully understood by now, such transactions are accompanied by higher trading and network fees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>As you can see, there is a reason why the final balance might be different from what you expected, and there is very little we at <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW</a> can do about it. The fees vary depending on the digital asset in question, how congested the network is at the time of the exchange, and how many steps we have to take to acquire the coin for you.  </p>\n<p>If you are sending coins from your private wallet, check the recommended mining fees on sites such as <a href=\"https://mempool.space/\">Mempool.Space.</a> You want to ensure you aren’t overpaying (if you are sending Bitcoin).

In 1994, he proposed the idea of a digital protocol that can be used to pass on information by using mathematical algorithms. Once the pre-arranged terms are fulfilled, the corresponding transaction is processed. </p>\n<p>But before blockchain tech came along, smart contracts had been missing the proper environment for development. Until Satoshi Nakamoto <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/bitcoin-explained-2\">introduced</a> blockchain in 2009, the logic of smart contracts did not make sense.  Although it is possible to program smart contracts on the Bitcoin network, the whole process will be difficult and the end result will be limited. But once the Solidity-powered <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network started growing, it proved to be the perfect ground for designing complex smart contracts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smart-contract-use-cases\">Smart Contract Use Cases</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to understand how smart contracts work is to use a real-life use case. Let’s say you want to rent out your apartment to someone you’re not familiar with. .The majority of people prefer to leave the paperwork to the real estate agents and let them handle the legal side of things. For their services, the agents receive commission.</p>\n<p>With smart contracts you won’t need help from any third parties. It is possible to use a smart contract with your future tenant which kicks in once the tenant transfers a certain amount of money to you.  You won&#39;t need to put blind trust in your tenant as the entire money-collection process will be automated.  What’s more, you can set a number of additional rules. For example, if they are late with the next monthly payment, you can charge them with a penalty fee. Or terminate the contract if they fail to pay rent during the pre-defined period of time.</p>\n<p>Smart contracts functionality is potentially limitless. Imagine buying a property and renting it out together with your partner. This sort of complex case can also be handled by smart contracts, so you will receive compensation based on your investment percentage. </p>\n<p>Real estate is not the only area where smart contracts can come in handy. Mortgages, insurance, voting, supply chain, e-commerce, various financial services, and any other industry that depends on transferring finance (or other value) can benefit from implementing the smart contract tech.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-smart-contracts-work\">How Do Smart Contracts Work?</h2>\n<p>The smart contract model requires three things to work properly: the participants, the terms they agree upon, and the subject of this agreement. Smart contracts  require <a href=\"https://changenow.io/faq/how-do-i-get-my-cryptocurrency-wallet-address\">public-key cryptography</a> and decentralized databases, so they can only operate in a blockchain environment. Ethereum is not the only blockchain network that enables the work of smart contracts. Apart from the above-mentioned Bitcoin network, blockchains such as <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/eos\">EOS</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tron\">TRON</a>, RSK, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/stellar\">Stellar</a>, and others support smart contracts too.</p>\n<p>The Solidity language used in the Ethereum network allows programmers to develop their own programs, including smart contracts.  The language is also compatible with a wider range of computational instructions.</p>\n<p>A smart contract can best be understood by comparing it to a vending machine.  You set up a program to get the product you need, pay the required amount, and the machine does all the work for you. To activate a smart contract you need to send a certain amount of cryptocurrency to the specified address, and in exchange you receive whatever you agreed for: a contract for the rental apartment, a property ownership, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-real-life-use-case\">A Real-Life Use Case</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let’s say Bob is looking to rent his apartment out to Alice. To do so, they create an agreement on the network that states, “If Alice sends $1,000 to Bob, then she can move into  the apartment tomorrow”. This information is recorded on a blockchain, which means that nobody can change the rules afterwards.  The smart contract verifies the identity of Bob and Alice using public-key cryptography.  Once Alice sends funds to the specified address, the contract allowing Alice to move in is released, and at the same time, Bob receives the funds. \nBob doesn’t need to remind Alice to pay the money, and Alice doesn’t need to worry that Bob will suddenly ask her to pay extra. And none of them needs to pay for the middleman services. Transparency and straightforwardness are hallmarks of the agreement, which is automatically executed once all the requirements are met.<br>Also, Bob can activate a chain of dependable smart contracts, where the second contract is activated once the first one is carried out successfully. This way he can easily handle monthly rental payments or other complex processes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"dapps-and-smart-contracts\">DApps And Smart Contracts</h2>\n<p>In the Ethereum network smart contracts and dApps walk hand in hand. DApp, a decentralized application, is an app built in the blockchain environment. Unlike traditional apps, a dApp doesn’t run on any server but uses a distributed system instead. It stores its data in a <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/what-is-decentralized-finance\">decentralized ledger</a> and typically supports an open-source model. </p>\n<p>Smart contracts are the driving engine of any dApp as they help them to store and process data. Although dApps might look like your regular app, the implementation of the smart contract tech makes them decentralized and transparent, and their transactions irreversible. Often, blockchains design their own tokens to fuel the work of dApps, while others prefer to stick to using Ether as the main transaction coin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downsides-of-smart-contracts\">Downsides of Smart Contracts</h2>\n<p>Smart contracts do sound like a technology of the future, but they still require some major improvements, like any other blockchain-based technology. </p>\n<p>One of the biggest downsides of smart contracts is their potential vulnerability. You have to make sure that the code behind the contracts is flawless. Otherwise, the whole system can be compromised. We’ve already witnessed several major cases, such as the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/dao-maker\">DAO</a> or the Parity wallet hacks, when the attackers used some loopholes in smart contracts to steal money.</p>\n<p>As of now, smart contracts lack taxation and regulation. Since the technology is still in its infancy, there is no set of rules approved at the government level to regulate it. What if the conditions that you agreed upon are not met in real life? For example, the apartment that you paid for via the smart contract turns out to be not up to standard. With a traditional contract, you could go to court to solve the issue, but with a smart contract it is not yet possible. </p>\n<p>In addition, smart contracts are not flexible and all transactions are irreversible. At the same time, this is one of their main advantages. On the one hand, it is a big advantage that nobody can tamper with the transaction code. On the other hand, you cannot undo it in case of a mistake.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Used independently or integrated into dApps, smart contracts provide a fast, independent, reliable, and affordable way to transmit any sort of value online without the involvement of third parties. Smart contracts are a perfect example of how decentralization made possible by blockchain technology can improve our daily lives.</p>\n<p>The smart contract technology has a great deal of potential, despite a few disadvantages like lack of regularity, mistakes in the code, and difficulty implementing them. The long-term benefits of using smart contracts can be implemented in various business areas, including real estate, e-commerce, supply chain, and healthcare. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Ex editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-15T17:20:50.693Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2021-11-22T16:57:33.069Z","createdAt":"2021-11-22T16:57:18.246Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-04T20:14:45.956Z"},{"id":752,"title":"Litecoin vs Bitcoin.

It is a peer-to-peer payment system through which users can transfer funds from one to another. The coin appeared in 2011 but was not a very popular cryptocurrency. However, in January 2013, Litecoin showed phenomenal growth by 20 times. As a result, the coin reached $1 bln. market capitalization and people started calling Litecoin an alternative to Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Litecoin_bd399ca2d1.png\" alt=\"Litecoin: History, Features, and BTC Comparison\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"litecoin-vs-bitcoin-difference-explained\">Litecoin vs Bitcoin. Difference Explained</h2>\n<p>Litecoin’s mission corresponds with the tasks that <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> was originally intended to solve. LTC serves as a means of payment, but more convenient, faster, and cheaper than fiat currencies. There are three main differences between BTC and LTC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Different hashing algorithms. Bitcoin runs on SHA-256, while Litecoin uses Scrypt, developed by FreeBSD security officer Colin Percival. Initially, it was created for the Tarsnap online service, but it was also integrated into cryptocurrencies.</li>\n<li>Faster block generation. Bitcoin blockchain generates a new block every 10 minutes, while in the Litecoin network this process takes only 2.5 minutes.</li>\n<li>Different maximum supply. Litecoin mining will stop when the total number of mined coins will reach 84 million. The maximum number of Bitcoins is 4 times less - 21 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-litecoin-better-than-bitcoin\">What Makes Litecoin Better Than Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, claims that LTC was not created to compete with BTC but to improve the original idea. There is no doubt Litecoin is faster and lighter than the original currency.</p>\n<p><strong>Transactions are faster due to the reduced block generation time</strong></p>\n<p>The faster the network processes payments, the shorter the transaction queues. Consequently, transfers can be carried out quickly without increased fees.</p>\n<p><strong>Improved capacity thanks to the SegWit algorithm</strong></p>\n<p>To solve the problem of network scaling, Litecoin uses the SegWit software algorithm. SegWit allows you to increase the efficiency of the blockchain without increasing the block size. LTC was the very first coin that implemented this technology. Later Bitcoin also integrated SegWit protocol as a soft fork.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-chain transactions with atomic swaps</strong></p>\n<p>Another relevant technology that has been introduced into Litecoin transactions is atomic swaps. Atomic swap is a technology that allows transactions between different blockchains. At the end of September 2017, the creator of the cryptocurrency, Charlie Lee, announced a successful implementation of three cross-chain transactions with Decred (DCR), Vertcoin (VTC), and Bitcoin (BTC).</p>\n<p><strong>Integration of the Lightning Network</strong></p>\n<p>Lightning Network is a sidechain technology or second layer for the blockchain network. The main goal of the Lightning Network is a faster operation of blockchain, in particular, the implementation of instant micropayments with lower fees than with regular transactions. Simply speaking, the Lightning Network allows users to make transactions directly with each other without sending information to the public blockchain. Thus, it helps to achieve faster and cheaper transactions, as well as reduce the amount of blockchain data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"litecoin-vs-bitcoin-in-mining\">Litecoin vs Bitcoin in Mining</h2>\n<p>Just like the Bitcoin blockchain, the Litecoin network uses the Proof of Work algorithm. At the moment, the reward for finding a block in the Litecoin network is 12.5 LTC. The number of coins received as a reward decreases every 840,000 blocks. Blocks are created every 2.5 minutes, which is four times faster than on the Bitcoin network. As a result, the coin issue is also four times faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disadvantages-of-litecoin\">Disadvantages of Litecoin</h2>\n<p><strong>No smart contracts.</strong> Litecoin cryptocurrency is used as a decentralized digital currency, and its blockchain does not allow creating smart contracts, as can be done with other cryptocurrencies (for example, Ethereum or NEO).</p>\n<p><strong>Mining is not profitable for ordinary users.</strong> Litecoin mining has become unprofitable for ordinary users who previously mined coins using video cards or CPUs. Now, due to the massive usage of ASIC, LTC mining can only be done with an expensive farm.</p>\n<p><strong>Not as popular as BTC.</strong> Even though Litecoin cryptocurrency uses the same technology as Bitcoin, it is not as popular as BTC. Bitcoin has become synonymous with the words &quot;blockchain&quot; and &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;, and the Litecoin cryptocurrency is just one of the top 10 coins.</p>\n<p><strong>Litecoin is an old-generation cryptocurrency.</strong> Modern blockchain projects can offer more advanced solutions in terms of scalability, interoperability, and so on. </p>\n<h2 id=\"litecoin-use-cases\">Litecoin Use Cases</h2>\n<p>Today Litecoin has one of the most developed communities in the crypto industry. Its founder Charlie Lee is a true media person who contributes to the further popularization of the platform. Thus, LTC often attracts various companies from different spheres.</p>\n<p>Litecoin is doing well as a means of payment. At the moment, this cryptocurrency can be used to buy tickets, Amazon gift cards, groceries in different stores, etc. One of the ambitious attempts to make LTC a widespread means of payment was to create a crypto payment processing service – the LitePay project. However, the startup faced various difficulties and the team had to shut it down.</p>\n<p>Also, Litcoin was among the first cryptocurrencies on the blockchain phone HTC Exodus. The smartphone works as a hardware wallet, stores private keys directly on the phone, and uses a secure blockchain environment to facilitate transactions.</p>\n<p>Among the latest news about Litecoin is their partnership with a game developer Atari. LTC holders will be able to buy an internal Atari token that will be used for purchases of digital assets in the Atari ecosystem, as well as make payments at Atari casinos.</p>\n<p>Also, LTC has partnered with MeconCash to install over 13,000 Litecoin ATMs throughout South Korea. The coin will be integrated into the M.Pay platform, allowing LTC holders to withdraw funds to fiat or send LTC to South Korea from abroad. The Litecoin team expects that the partnership will help LTC to gain popularity in South Korea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Although the crypto market offers many other technologically advanced projects, Litecoin remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies and stays in the Top-10 of the CoinMarketCap rating.</p>\n<p>The Litecoin team continues to work on different fronts, trying to increase the number of LTC holders. The project constantly attracts new investors and implements technological innovations. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":2,"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Vaughan","description":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","slug":"doloresvaughan","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/doloresvaughan","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Crypto expert","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Dolores Vaughan","metaDescription":"Freelance crypto copywriter ","image":{"id":2609,"name":"Stephanie.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Copywriter ","caption":"","hash":"Stephanie_2ab7f29e25","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Stephanie_2ab7f29e25.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.443Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:37.462Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["academy"],"publishedAt":"2021-09-28T15:17:42.215Z","createdAt":"2021-09-28T15:17:28.770Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-04T19:15:51.905Z"}],"blogCategory":{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null},"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.211Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.917Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-09T14:30:09.368Z"}}</script><script src="../../../dist/runtime.f26d9116b54d75635181.js" defer></script><script src="../../../dist/blog-page.ca364de5fa99b7bd27d0.js" defer></script></body></html>
