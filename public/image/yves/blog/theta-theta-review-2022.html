    "articleBody": "<p>As a result, companies such as YouTube increase their revenues every year. The problem is that most of this money flows into the pockets of centralized platforms and not into those belonging to content creators and consumers. What if we could create a fairer system for everyone involved?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thetatoken.org/\">Theta</a> wants to do just that. Their team is aware of the problems concerning content delivery and believes the solution to the issue is a decentralized P2P blockchain network that awards all parties that contribute to its successes. Everyone can become part of Theta, so let’s see how the online video industry can improve thanks to decentralized blockchain technology.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca.png\" alt=\"Theta (THETA) Review 2022\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"about-theta-theta\">About Theta (THETA)</h2>\n<p>Theta is a streaming platform for videos and a <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong>. The project aims to improve the quality of streamed content and decrease the viewer’s loading times. The network was created by San Francisco-based software company <strong>Theta Labs, Inc</strong>. in 2017 and raised <strong>$20 million</strong> in a token sale the same year.</p>\n<p>With the rise of streaming needs and increased interest in blockchain technology, the team behind the platform concluded that it would be best to combine these two technologies into a complete solution. </p>\n<p>The problem with modern video streaming is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The picture quality varies depending on your geographical location. Many parts of the word experience re-buffering and loading issues.</li>\n<li>The viewers want to consume 4k and 8k videos but can’t due to inefficient delivery systems. </li>\n<li>Because of centralized CDN setups, viewers and content creators reap little to no benefits from traditional platforms. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theta aims to solve this with its P2P and blockchain-powered delivery service that incentivizes all users (consumers and creators) to participate in the network.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viewers receive TFUEL cryptocurrency for watching videos and sharing their non-used bandwidth with the community. </li>\n<li>The decentralized nature of the system can guarantee the same viewing experience in all parts of the world.</li>\n<li>The cost of delivering streaming services is reduced because there is no need to purchase expensive hardware infrastructure. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theta is an open-source project suitable for various needs. It can host eSports, VR content, music, movies, and do live streaming. The network possesses smart-contract functionalities and allows developers to build their own decentralized applications and protocols. </p>\n<h2 id=\"theta-theta-team\">Theta (THETA) Team</h2>\n<p>Theta has two co-founders: <strong>Mitch Liu</strong>, the company CEO, and <strong>Jieyi Long</strong>, Theta’s CTO. Both developers worked together on THETA.tv and realized that a different approach to traditional video streaming was needed. </p>\n<p>The company’s blockchain team consists of 21 engineers, developers, and managers. In addition, Theta has dozens of investors, including popular venture funds and technology giants such as Sony or Samsung. </p>\n<p>This service provider shines when it comes to its advisory team. Several influential figures from Twitch, Microsoft, Sony, or Verizon are all official Theta advisors. However, the most notable one is <strong>Steve Chen</strong>, the co-founder of YouTube. Steve is a big fan of the project and believes it will disrupt the video industry by offering more superb image quality at lower prices. </p>\n<p>Last but not least, we should mention Theta’s partner network. Powerful names such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Lionsgate, NASA, Katy Perry, Chainlink, FailArmy, or the World Poker Tour are all cooperating with Theta in one way or another.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"theta-theta-roadmap\">Theta (THETA) Roadmap</h2>\n<p>The project’s roadmap can be found on the official website. Among the achievements for 2021, we will mention the following two feats: Theta is now supported by hardware wallet producer Ledger. And the beta version of an NFT marketplace called <a href=\"https://www.thetadrop.com/\">ThetaDrop </a>has been released and is being tested.    </p>\n<p>These are Theta’s plans for Q1 of 2022:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new digital asset will be released on the mainnet. <strong>TDROP</strong> is an NFT token created for liquidity mining.</li>\n<li>A cross-chain bridge between THETA and ETH will be made for DEX, NFT and dApp communication.</li>\n<li>Theta’s Elite Edge Nodes will have a feature to store NFTs in a decentralized manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The roadmap for Q2 of 2022 looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An NFT-based video platform with P2P video sharing is planned to be released as beta.</li>\n<li>Users will be introduced to a <em>Live experience video streaming platform</em>.</li>\n<li>Improvements are scheduled for Edge Streaming Nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"theta-theta-network\">Theta (THETA) Network</h2>\n<p>The Theta blockchain is based on Ethereum, and hence it’s a Proof-of-Stake (POS) coin. It supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens and smart contracts. The network uses a <strong>Multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerant</strong> consensus algorithm, which allows it to process around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf-Op-1peZI\">1.000 transactions per second</a>.</p>\n<p>Theta uses various nodes to protect its blockchain, verify transactions, and host video content. The first type is the validators, known as <strong>Enterprise Validator Nodes</strong>. As of February 2022, there are 16 validator nodes operated by Theta Labs and several renowned companies such as Google, Sony, Samsung, Binance, etc.</p>\n<p>Around 3.500 <strong>Guardian Nodes</strong> make up the 2nd part of the consensus group. And finally, there are over 130.000 <strong>Edge Nodes</strong> on the Theta blockchain. As the name might suggest, the guardians are responsible for safekeeping the blockchain if Validator nodes get hacked or start acting maliciously. Guardian Nodes also have double-checking responsibilities, and they inspect everything that Validator Nodes are doing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/photo_2022_02_18_12_56_08_c24aa5e50a.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2022-02-18 12.56.08.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>Edge Nodes provide computational power to relay videos on Theta’s decentralized content sharing and delivery platform. This service is known as <strong><a href=\"https://community.theta.tv/theta-edgecast/\">EdgeCast</a></strong>. EdgeCast’s decentralized nature doesn’t allow Theta to control, censor, or delete content uploaded to it. This is the exact opposite of what YouTube is doing.</p>\n<p>Besides censorship resistance, what else makes Theta different from centralized streaming networks? CDNs ensure that the videos you watch are delivered to you in good quality. If you live in the city, a data server provides that content to you. But data centers aren’t available in all places of the world, like deserts, wastelands, forests, Siberia, and less-developed regions in Africa and East Asia. </p>\n<p>The missing infrastructure causes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ByurH6sMKQ\">lag and a low-quality streaming experience</a> for viewers. Moreover, building and maintaining this infrastructure is costly. That’s where Theta’s blockchain comes into play. The platform incentivizes users to make their bandwidth and computational power available to Theta by creating <strong>The Global Cache</strong>. The streaming service is thus fully functional and non-dependent on Content Delivery Networks.  </p>\n<p>Instead of getting videos from CDNs, Theta users obtain them from peers who are part of The Global Cache network. You, as a viewer, have to pay a certain number of tokens to watch videos and become a content host yourself. But then someone else pays you, creating a circle of spending and earning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-tokens-of-the-theta-network\">The Tokens of the Theta Network</h3>\n<p>Theta uses a dual token system on its blockchain. <strong>THETA</strong> is used as a staking coin and an asset for security and network governance. The 2<sup>nd</sup> token is <strong>TFUEL</strong>, used for transaction fees, smart contract operations, and staking rewards. THETA has a maximum supply of 1 billion units, while TFUEL’s upper limit is 5 billion. TFUEL is a deflationary asset. All tokens used for transaction fees are permanently burned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-theta-and-tfuel-tokens\">How to Mine THETA and TFUEL Tokens?</h2>\n<p>Theta is a POS-based project, so it can’t be mined, but it can be staked. Staking is done via the official <a href=\"https://wallet.thetatoken.org/unlock/keystore-file\">Theta Web Wallet</a>. A minimum stake of <strong>1.000 THETA tokens</strong> is required to participate in the staking process. This allows the user to become a Guardian Node.</p>\n<p>Staking can be done on a PC or using the mobile version of the wallet, which is available for both iOS and Android devices. The rewards depend on the number of staked tokens and are paid out in Theta Fuel (TFUEL). You can withdraw your stakes when you are done, and the funds will be returned to your address within 48 hours. </p>\n<p>Edge Nodes who earn TFUEL by hosting and relaying videos can also participate in the staking process. By staking their Theta Fuel tokens, they become <strong>Elite Edge Nodes</strong>. The minimum deposit stake is <strong>10.000 TFUEL</strong>, and the max is capped at <strong>500.000 coins</strong>. The un-staking period can take up to 60 hours before the tokens are returned to your wallet. </p>\n<h2 id=\"tfuel-and-theta-token-price-prediction-2022\">TFUEL and THETA Token Price Prediction 2022</h2>\n<p>Since THETA officially started trading on exchanges, it has generated an ROI of over 2100%. 2021 was its best year performance-wise. From March until April 2021, THETA token price skyrocketed as it went from $3 to an ATH of almost $16 on 16 April 2021. As of February 2022, the coin is trading at around $4.</p>\n<p>Many forecasters agree that the asset has plenty of room for improvement. <a href=\"https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/theta-prediction#predicted-prices\">Wallet Investor </a> expects the price of THETA token to increase over 100% one year from now, with trades carried out at around $11.50/coin. It’s believed the asset will break the $20 barrier for the first time in January 2024 before climbing further to the $35-$40 mark in 2026.</p>\n<p>Analysts from <strong><a href=\"https://tradingbeasts.com/price-prediction/theta-network\">TradingBeasts</a></strong> believe that THETA is a good investment. They don’t expect much to happen with it during 2022 when they predict movements between $3 and $5. A +100% ROI is expected in 2025 when the average price is believed to be between $9 and $10.</p>\n<p>TFUEL is currently trading at above $0.23/coin. It had also registered remarkable gains during 2021 when the all-time high of $0.68 was recorded at the beginning of June. Theta Fuel has gone up 24.000% since then in relation to its lowest value.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/theta-fuel-prediction\">Wallet Investor</a></strong> predictors are extremely bullish on TFUEL. Their 1-year forecast shows a price increase to $0.44. In addition, 2023 is expected to be a year when this digital asset trades in the $0.50-$0.60 range. If they are correct, the token will be worth at least $1 in 2025, and the 5-year forecast shows a price of over $1.30.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gov.capital/crypto/theta-fuel/\">GOV Capital</a></strong> has even more faith in Theta Fuel. In the next 12 months, they predict a value increase to $0.70. Their technical analysis team believes that the price of TFUEL will cross the $1 mark in March 2023. The $3 line could be breached in 2025, and a jump to $4.50 is expected to happen in 2027.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-and-trade-theta-and-tfuel\">How to Buy and Trade THETA and TFUEL?</h2>\n<p>Both tokens can be traded on a plethora of cryptocurrency exchanges and stored in software and hardware wallets. Let’s mention some of the most recommended options available right now.    </p>\n<h3 id=\"theta-and-tfuel-wallets\">THETA and TFUEL Wallets</h3>\n<p>If you want 1<sup>st</sup> class privacy and security for your crypto, we suggest storing your Theta coins in non-custodial wallets such as the <strong><a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a></strong>.

The problem is that most of this money flows into the pockets of centralized platforms and not into those belonging to content creators and consumers. What if we could create a fairer system for everyone involved?</p>
<p>Theta wants to do just that. Their team is aware of the problems concerning content delivery and believes the solution to the issue is a decentralized P2P blockchain network that awards all parties that contribute to its successes. Everyone can become part of Theta, so let’s see how the online video industry can improve thanks to decentralized blockchain technology.</p>
<p><img src="../../content-api-sub/uploads/02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca.png" alt="Theta (THETA) Review 2022"></p>
<h2 id="about-theta-theta">About Theta (THETA)</h2>
<p>Theta is a streaming platform for videos and a <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong>. The project aims to improve the quality of streamed content and decrease the viewer’s loading times. The network was created by San Francisco-based software company <strong>Theta Labs, Inc</strong>. in 2017 and raised <strong>$20 million</strong> in a token sale the same year.</p>
<p>With the rise of streaming needs and increased interest in blockchain technology, the team behind the platform concluded that it would be best to combine these two technologies into a complete solution. </p>
<p>The problem with modern video streaming is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The picture quality varies depending on your geographical location. Many parts of the word experience re-buffering and loading issues.</li>
<li>The viewers want to consume 4k and 8k videos but can’t due to inefficient delivery systems. </li>
<li>Because of centralized CDN setups, viewers and content creators reap little to no benefits from traditional platforms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Theta aims to solve this with its P2P and blockchain-powered delivery service that incentivizes all users (consumers and creators) to participate in the network.</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewers receive TFUEL cryptocurrency for watching videos and sharing their non-used bandwidth with the community. </li>
<li>The decentralized nature of the system can guarantee the same viewing experience in all parts of the world.</li>
<li>The cost of delivering streaming services is reduced because there is no need to purchase expensive hardware infrastructure. </li>
</ul>
<p>Theta is an open-source project suitable for various needs. It can host eSports, VR content, music, movies, and do live streaming. The network possesses smart-contract functionalities and allows developers to build their own decentralized applications and protocols. </p>
<h2 id="theta-theta-team">Theta (THETA) Team</h2>
<p>Theta has two co-founders: <strong>Mitch Liu</strong>, the company CEO, and <strong>Jieyi Long</strong>, Theta’s CTO. Both developers worked together on THETA.tv and realized that a different approach to traditional video streaming was needed. </p>
<p>The company’s blockchain team consists of 21 engineers, developers, and managers. In addition, Theta has dozens of investors, including popular venture funds and technology giants such as Sony or Samsung. </p>
<p>This service provider shines when it comes to its advisory team. Several influential figures from Twitch, Microsoft, Sony, or Verizon are all official Theta advisors. However, the most notable one is <strong>Steve Chen</strong>, the co-founder of YouTube. Steve is a big fan of the project and believes it will disrupt the video industry by offering more superb image quality at lower prices. </p>
<p>Last but not least, we should mention Theta’s partner network. Powerful names such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Lionsgate, NASA, Katy Perry, Chainlink, FailArmy, or the World Poker Tour are all cooperating with Theta in one way or another.  </p>
<h2 id="theta-theta-roadmap">Theta (THETA) Roadmap</h2>
<p>The project’s roadmap can be found on the official website. Among the achievements for 2021, we will mention the following two feats: Theta is now supported by hardware wallet producer Ledger. And the beta version of an NFT marketplace called ThetaDrop has been released and is being tested.    </p>
<p>These are Theta’s plans for Q1 of 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new digital asset will be released on the mainnet. <strong>TDROP</strong> is an NFT token created for liquidity mining.</li>
<li>A cross-chain bridge between THETA and ETH will be made for DEX, NFT and dApp communication.</li>
<li>Theta’s Elite Edge Nodes will have a feature to store NFTs in a decentralized manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>The roadmap for Q2 of 2022 looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>An NFT-based video platform with P2P video sharing is planned to be released as beta.</li>
<li>Users will be introduced to a <em>Live experience video streaming platform</em>.</li>
<li>Improvements are scheduled for Edge Streaming Nodes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theta-theta-network">Theta (THETA) Network</h2>
<p>The Theta blockchain is based on Ethereum, and hence it’s a Proof-of-Stake (POS) coin. It supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens and smart contracts. The network uses a <strong>Multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerant</strong> consensus algorithm, which allows it to process around 1.000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Theta uses various nodes to protect its blockchain, verify transactions, and host video content. The first type is the validators, known as <strong>Enterprise Validator Nodes</strong>. As of February 2022, there are 16 validator nodes operated by Theta Labs and several renowned companies such as Google, Sony, Samsung, Binance, etc.</p>
<p>Around 3.500 <strong>Guardian Nodes</strong> make up the 2nd part of the consensus group. And finally, there are over 130.000 <strong>Edge Nodes</strong> on the Theta blockchain. As the name might suggest, the guardians are responsible for safekeeping the blockchain if Validator nodes get hacked or start acting maliciously. Guardian Nodes also have double-checking responsibilities, and they inspect everything that Validator Nodes are doing.</p>
<p><img src="../../content-api-sub/uploads/photo_2022_02_18_12_56_08_c24aa5e50a.jpg" alt="photo_2022-02-18 12.56.08.jpeg"></p>
<p>Edge Nodes provide computational power to relay videos on Theta’s decentralized content sharing and delivery platform. This service is known as <strong>EdgeCast</strong>. EdgeCast’s decentralized nature doesn’t allow Theta to control, censor, or delete content uploaded to it. This is the exact opposite of what YouTube is doing.</p>
<p>Besides censorship resistance, what else makes Theta different from centralized streaming networks? CDNs ensure that the videos you watch are delivered to you in good quality. If you live in the city, a data server provides that content to you. But data centers aren’t available in all places of the world, like deserts, wastelands, forests, Siberia, and less-developed regions in Africa and East Asia. </p>
<p>The missing infrastructure causes lag and a low-quality streaming experience for viewers. Moreover, building and maintaining this infrastructure is costly. That’s where Theta’s blockchain comes into play. The platform incentivizes users to make their bandwidth and computational power available to Theta by creating <strong>The Global Cache</strong>. The streaming service is thus fully functional and non-dependent on Content Delivery Networks.  </p>
<p>Instead of getting videos from CDNs, Theta users obtain them from peers who are part of The Global Cache network. You, as a viewer, have to pay a certain number of tokens to watch videos and become a content host yourself. But then someone else pays you, creating a circle of spending and earning.</p>
<h3 id="the-tokens-of-the-theta-network">The Tokens of the Theta Network</h3>
<p>Theta uses a dual token system on its blockchain. <strong>THETA</strong> is used as a staking coin and an asset for security and network governance. The 2<sup>nd</sup> token is <strong>TFUEL</strong>, used for transaction fees, smart contract operations, and staking rewards. THETA has a maximum supply of 1 billion units, while TFUEL’s upper limit is 5 billion. TFUEL is a deflationary asset. All tokens used for transaction fees are permanently burned.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-mine-theta-and-tfuel-tokens">How to Mine THETA and TFUEL Tokens?</h2>
<p>Theta is a POS-based project, so it can’t be mined, but it can be staked. Staking is done via the official Theta Web Wallet. A minimum stake of <strong>1.000 THETA tokens</strong> is required to participate in the staking process. This allows the user to become a Guardian Node.</p>
<p>Staking can be done on a PC or using the mobile version of the wallet, which is available for both iOS and Android devices. The rewards depend on the number of staked tokens and are paid out in Theta Fuel (TFUEL). You can withdraw your stakes when you are done, and the funds will be returned to your address within 48 hours. </p>
<p>Edge Nodes who earn TFUEL by hosting and relaying videos can also participate in the staking process. By staking their Theta Fuel tokens, they become <strong>Elite Edge Nodes</strong>. The minimum deposit stake is <strong>10.000 TFUEL</strong>, and the max is capped at <strong>500.000 coins</strong>. The un-staking period can take up to 60 hours before the tokens are returned to your wallet. </p>
<h2 id="tfuel-and-theta-token-price-prediction-2022">TFUEL and THETA Token Price Prediction 2022</h2>
<p>Since THETA officially started trading on exchanges, it has generated an ROI of over 2100%. 2021 was its best year performance-wise. From March until April 2021, THETA token price skyrocketed as it went from $3 to an ATH of almost $16 on 16 April 2021. As of February 2022, the coin is trading at around $4.</p>
<p>Many forecasters agree that the asset has plenty of room for improvement. Wallet Investor  expects the price of THETA token to increase over 100% one year from now, with trades carried out at around $11.50/coin. It’s believed the asset will break the $20 barrier for the first time in January 2024 before climbing further to the $35-$40 mark in 2026.</p>
<p>Analysts from <strong>TradingBeasts</strong> believe that THETA is a good investment. They don’t expect much to happen with it during 2022 when they predict movements between $3 and $5. A +100% ROI is expected in 2025 when the average price is believed to be between $9 and $10.</p>
<p>TFUEL is currently trading at above $0.23/coin. It had also registered remarkable gains during 2021 when the all-time high of $0.68 was recorded at the beginning of June. Theta Fuel has gone up 24.000% since then in relation to its lowest value.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Investor</strong> predictors are extremely bullish on TFUEL. Their 1-year forecast shows a price increase to $0.44. In addition, 2023 is expected to be a year when this digital asset trades in the $0.50-$0.60 range. If they are correct, the token will be worth at least $1 in 2025, and the 5-year forecast shows a price of over $1.30.</p>
<p><strong>GOV Capital</strong> has even more faith in Theta Fuel. In the next 12 months, they predict a value increase to $0.70. Their technical analysis team believes that the price of TFUEL will cross the $1 mark in March 2023. The $3 line could be breached in 2025, and a jump to $4.50 is expected to happen in 2027.</p>

The problem is that most of this money flows into the pockets of centralized platforms and not into those belonging to content creators and consumers. What if we could create a fairer system for everyone involved?</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.thetatoken.org/\\\">Theta</a> wants to do just that. Their team is aware of the problems concerning content delivery and believes the solution to the issue is a decentralized P2P blockchain network that awards all parties that contribute to its successes. Everyone can become part of Theta, so let’s see how the online video industry can improve thanks to decentralized blockchain technology.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca.png\\\" alt=\\\"Theta (THETA) Review 2022\\\" ></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"about-theta-theta\\\">About Theta (THETA)</h2>\\n<p>Theta is a streaming platform for videos and a <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong>. The project aims to improve the quality of streamed content and decrease the viewer’s loading times. The network was created by San Francisco-based software company <strong>Theta Labs, Inc</strong>. in 2017 and raised <strong>$20 million</strong> in a token sale the same year.</p>\\n<p>With the rise of streaming needs and increased interest in blockchain technology, the team behind the platform concluded that it would be best to combine these two technologies into a complete solution. </p>\\n<p>The problem with modern video streaming is the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The picture quality varies depending on your geographical location. Many parts of the word experience re-buffering and loading issues.</li>\\n<li>The viewers want to consume 4k and 8k videos but can’t due to inefficient delivery systems. </li>\\n<li>Because of centralized CDN setups, viewers and content creators reap little to no benefits from traditional platforms. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Theta aims to solve this with its P2P and blockchain-powered delivery service that incentivizes all users (consumers and creators) to participate in the network.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Viewers receive TFUEL cryptocurrency for watching videos and sharing their non-used bandwidth with the community. </li>\\n<li>The decentralized nature of the system can guarantee the same viewing experience in all parts of the world.</li>\\n<li>The cost of delivering streaming services is reduced because there is no need to purchase expensive hardware infrastructure. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Theta is an open-source project suitable for various needs. It can host eSports, VR content, music, movies, and do live streaming. The network possesses smart-contract functionalities and allows developers to build their own decentralized applications and protocols. </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"theta-theta-team\\\">Theta (THETA) Team</h2>\\n<p>Theta has two co-founders: <strong>Mitch Liu</strong>, the company CEO, and <strong>Jieyi Long</strong>, Theta’s CTO. Both developers worked together on THETA.tv and realized that a different approach to traditional video streaming was needed. </p>\\n<p>The company’s blockchain team consists of 21 engineers, developers, and managers. In addition, Theta has dozens of investors, including popular venture funds and technology giants such as Sony or Samsung. </p>\\n<p>This service provider shines when it comes to its advisory team. Several influential figures from Twitch, Microsoft, Sony, or Verizon are all official Theta advisors. However, the most notable one is <strong>Steve Chen</strong>, the co-founder of YouTube. Steve is a big fan of the project and believes it will disrupt the video industry by offering more superb image quality at lower prices. </p>\\n<p>Last but not least, we should mention Theta’s partner network. Powerful names such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Lionsgate, NASA, Katy Perry, Chainlink, FailArmy, or the World Poker Tour are all cooperating with Theta in one way or another.  </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"theta-theta-roadmap\\\">Theta (THETA) Roadmap</h2>\\n<p>The project’s roadmap can be found on the official website. Among the achievements for 2021, we will mention the following two feats: Theta is now supported by hardware wallet producer Ledger. And the beta version of an NFT marketplace called <a href=\\\"https://www.thetadrop.com/\\\">ThetaDrop </a>has been released and is being tested.    </p>\\n<p>These are Theta’s plans for Q1 of 2022:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A new digital asset will be released on the mainnet. <strong>TDROP</strong> is an NFT token created for liquidity mining.</li>\\n<li>A cross-chain bridge between THETA and ETH will be made for DEX, NFT and dApp communication.</li>\\n<li>Theta’s Elite Edge Nodes will have a feature to store NFTs in a decentralized manner.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The roadmap for Q2 of 2022 looks like this:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An NFT-based video platform with P2P video sharing is planned to be released as beta.</li>\\n<li>Users will be introduced to a <em>Live experience video streaming platform</em>.</li>\\n<li>Improvements are scheduled for Edge Streaming Nodes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"theta-theta-network\\\">Theta (THETA) Network</h2>\\n<p>The Theta blockchain is based on Ethereum, and hence it’s a Proof-of-Stake (POS) coin. It supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens and smart contracts. The network uses a <strong>Multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerant</strong> consensus algorithm, which allows it to process around <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf-Op-1peZI\\\">1.000 transactions per second</a>.</p>\\n<p>Theta uses various nodes to protect its blockchain, verify transactions, and host video content. The first type is the validators, known as <strong>Enterprise Validator Nodes</strong>. As of February 2022, there are 16 validator nodes operated by Theta Labs and several renowned companies such as Google, Sony, Samsung, Binance, etc.</p>\\n<p>Around 3.500 <strong>Guardian Nodes</strong> make up the 2nd part of the consensus group. And finally, there are over 130.000 <strong>Edge Nodes</strong> on the Theta blockchain. As the name might suggest, the guardians are responsible for safekeeping the blockchain if Validator nodes get hacked or start acting maliciously. Guardian Nodes also have double-checking responsibilities, and they inspect everything that Validator Nodes are doing.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/photo_2022_02_18_12_56_08_c24aa5e50a.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"photo_2022-02-18 12.56.08.jpeg\\\" ></p>\\n<p>Edge Nodes provide computational power to relay videos on Theta’s decentralized content sharing and delivery platform. This service is known as <strong><a href=\\\"https://community.theta.tv/theta-edgecast/\\\">EdgeCast</a></strong>. EdgeCast’s decentralized nature doesn’t allow Theta to control, censor, or delete content uploaded to it. This is the exact opposite of what YouTube is doing.</p>\\n<p>Besides censorship resistance, what else makes Theta different from centralized streaming networks? CDNs ensure that the videos you watch are delivered to you in good quality. If you live in the city, a data server provides that content to you. But data centers aren’t available in all places of the world, like deserts, wastelands, forests, Siberia, and less-developed regions in Africa and East Asia. </p>\\n<p>The missing infrastructure causes <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ByurH6sMKQ\\\">lag and a low-quality streaming experience</a> for viewers. Moreover, building and maintaining this infrastructure is costly. That’s where Theta’s blockchain comes into play. The platform incentivizes users to make their bandwidth and computational power available to Theta by creating <strong>The Global Cache</strong>. The streaming service is thus fully functional and non-dependent on Content Delivery Networks.  </p>\\n<p>Instead of getting videos from CDNs, Theta users obtain them from peers who are part of The Global Cache network. You, as a viewer, have to pay a certain number of tokens to watch videos and become a content host yourself. But then someone else pays you, creating a circle of spending and earning.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-tokens-of-the-theta-network\\\">The Tokens of the Theta Network</h3>\\n<p>Theta uses a dual token system on its blockchain. <strong>THETA</strong> is used as a staking coin and an asset for security and network governance. The 2<sup>nd</sup> token is <strong>TFUEL</strong>, used for transaction fees, smart contract operations, and staking rewards. THETA has a maximum supply of 1 billion units, while TFUEL’s upper limit is 5 billion. TFUEL is a deflationary asset. All tokens used for transaction fees are permanently burned.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"how-to-mine-theta-and-tfuel-tokens\\\">How to Mine THETA and TFUEL Tokens?</h2>\\n<p>Theta is a POS-based project, so it can’t be mined, but it can be staked. Staking is done via the official <a href=\\\"https://wallet.thetatoken.org/unlock/keystore-file\\\">Theta Web Wallet</a>. A minimum stake of <strong>1.000 THETA tokens</strong> is required to participate in the staking process. This allows the user to become a Guardian Node.</p>\\n<p>Staking can be done on a PC or using the mobile version of the wallet, which is available for both iOS and Android devices. The rewards depend on the number of staked tokens and are paid out in Theta Fuel (TFUEL). You can withdraw your stakes when you are done, and the funds will be returned to your address within 48 hours. </p>\\n<p>Edge Nodes who earn TFUEL by hosting and relaying videos can also participate in the staking process. By staking their Theta Fuel tokens, they become <strong>Elite Edge Nodes</strong>. The minimum deposit stake is <strong>10.000 TFUEL</strong>, and the max is capped at <strong>500.000 coins</strong>. The un-staking period can take up to 60 hours before the tokens are returned to your wallet. </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"tfuel-and-theta-token-price-prediction-2022\\\">TFUEL and THETA Token Price Prediction 2022</h2>\\n<p>Since THETA officially started trading on exchanges, it has generated an ROI of over 2100%. 2021 was its best year performance-wise. From March until April 2021, THETA token price skyrocketed as it went from $3 to an ATH of almost $16 on 16 April 2021. As of February 2022, the coin is trading at around $4.</p>\\n<p>Many forecasters agree that the asset has plenty of room for improvement. <a href=\\\"https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/theta-prediction#predicted-prices\\\">Wallet Investor </a> expects the price of THETA token to increase over 100% one year from now, with trades carried out at around $11.50/coin. It’s believed the asset will break the $20 barrier for the first time in January 2024 before climbing further to the $35-$40 mark in 2026.</p>\\n<p>Analysts from <strong><a href=\\\"https://tradingbeasts.com/price-prediction/theta-network\\\">TradingBeasts</a></strong> believe that THETA is a good investment. They don’t expect much to happen with it during 2022 when they predict movements between $3 and $5. A +100% ROI is expected in 2025 when the average price is believed to be between $9 and $10.</p>\\n<p>TFUEL is currently trading at above $0.23/coin. It had also registered remarkable gains during 2021 when the all-time high of $0.68 was recorded at the beginning of June. Theta Fuel has gone up 24.000% since then in relation to its lowest value.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href=\\\"https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/theta-fuel-prediction\\\">Wallet Investor</a></strong> predictors are extremely bullish on TFUEL. Their 1-year forecast shows a price increase to $0.44. In addition, 2023 is expected to be a year when this digital asset trades in the $0.50-$0.60 range. If they are correct, the token will be worth at least $1 in 2025, and the 5-year forecast shows a price of over $1.30.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href=\\\"https://gov.capital/crypto/theta-fuel/\\\">GOV Capital</a></strong> has even more faith in Theta Fuel. In the next 12 months, they predict a value increase to $0.70. Their technical analysis team believes that the price of TFUEL will cross the $1 mark in March 2023. The $3 line could be breached in 2025, and a jump to $4.50 is expected to happen in 2027.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"how-to-buy-and-trade-theta-and-tfuel\\\">How to Buy and Trade THETA and TFUEL?</h2>\\n<p>Both tokens can be traded on a plethora of cryptocurrency exchanges and stored in software and hardware wallets.

Its main features include professional charting tools for financial markets and a graphical interface that makes it possible to track and predict market trends. Lastly, it’s used for the analysis of profitable investment opportunities. </p>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market has found its own user base on <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/\">TradingView</a>. With a little bit of training, you can learn how to analyze crypto charts to make better financial decisions concerning your investments. The cryptocurrency markets aren’t that different from traditional financial markets, but they have their own characteristics and peculiarities.     </p>\n<p>Let’s now see how to analyze a TradingView chart and understand what it shows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-what-candlesticks-and-candlestick-charts-are\">Understanding What Candlesticks and Candlestick Charts Are</h2>\n<p><strong>Candlesticks</strong> show the price of a particular asset in a specific period. So by looking at a candle, we can see a few different things. </p>\n<p>Take a look at this <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/cDwWYDni/\">Bitcoin/USDT chart from TradingView</a> to understand what information a single candlestick entails.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_24a24a038d.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>A candle is made up of a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>wick</strong>. The body is the wide part of the image, and the narrow lines you see above and under it are called wicks. The size of the body depends on the price movement in that time period. For example, suppose these candles are for the 1-hour chart. In that case, the body shows how much the price fluctuated during that hour.</p>\n<p>Candlesticks can be <strong>green</strong> or <strong>red</strong>. A green candle on a 1-hour chart shows that the price closed above the value it opened at after one hour. Opposite to that, a red candle shows that the closing value has depreciated compared to the valuation at the start of that period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-how-do-we-know-where-the-price-opened-and-where-it-closed\">But how do we know where the price opened and where it closed?</h3>\n<p>Look at the body of the green candle above. The bottom line of its body was the asset&#39;s price when that time period started. The top of the body represents the value when the timeframe ended. The wicks show the highest and lowest value the price moved to during that period. The wick on top is obviously the high, while the one at the bottom is the low.</p>\n<p>A red candle is an exact opposite. The top of this candle’s body is the opening price, while the bottom is the closing one. The wick lines are the same as with the bullish green candlestick.</p>\n<p>When we group these candles together, we get a <strong>candlestick chart</strong> that looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed2_aabbd8489a.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed2.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"recognizing-trends-and-market-movements-based-on-candlesticks\">Recognizing Trends and Market Movements Based on Candlesticks</h2>\n<p>Now that we know what candlesticks are, we can look at TradingView charts and try to predict <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynxyoKgpng\">trending markets</a></strong>. Knowing whether we are in an <strong>upward</strong> or <strong>downward</strong> trend makes it easier to predict what happens next and when and where to place our buy and sell orders. Making trading decisions based on a current trend is a popular strategy because it’s easier than predicting when a bear or bull market is likely to start.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uptrend-markets\">Uptrend Markets</h3>\n<p>When the market is in an uptrend, you will notice that the candles create the following movements: new highs, followed by higher lows, new higher highs, new higher lows, etc., in regular intervals. </p>\n<p>Here is an excellent example of how that looks on a candlestick chart:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_8ca27c835e.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>But not all graphs are that simple, and sometimes it is difficult to recognize the patterns of a trending market. Therefore, there are some other indicators you should pay attention to.</p>\n<p>One interesting thing we can watch out for in trending markets are so-called <strong>impulsive moves</strong>. Whenever a price change leads to reaching a new high, we call that an <strong>impulsive move</strong>. After such an event, we often see a <strong>pullback</strong>. A pullback in an uptrend is when the value drops down from its peak for a brief period.</p>\n<p>To check whether the market is still trending upwards, we need to look at the charts and check the lowest closing price of the previous pullback. The value can’t close below that price for the market to still be considered an uptrend. When we see an impulsive move followed by a new high, the subsequent price action will be a pullback. The latest lowest point of that pullback must be above the line of the previous one. If it isn’t and closes below it, we may be witnessing a <strong>reversal</strong> and an end of the uptrend movement. </p>\n<p>This is how it looks on our previous graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_19215e9c9e.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h3 id=\"downtrend-markets\">Downtrend Markets</h3>\n<p>Using the opposite rules that we applied to upward movements, a downward market is recognized by lower lows and lower highs than what we witnessed previously. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_62fab9b0f8.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>We will use the same logic with impulsive moves and pullbacks to determine whether we are still in a downward trending market. However, a pullback will cause a slight rise in the asset’s value in this scenario.</p>\n<p>When we have an impulsive move followed by a pullback, the market can’t close above the highest point of the previous pullback. As long as it stays below, we are still in a downtrend market. </p>\n<p>Here we can see that represented on the graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_cb80af26fd.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"support--resistance-what-is-it-and-how-to-take-advantage-of-it\">Support & Resistance: What Is It and How to Take Advantage of It?</h2>\n<p>Support and resistance are zones where a traded asset finds a type of barrier that prevents it from further growth or decline. For example, if Bitcoin’s value drops, <strong>support</strong> will act as a safe zone to stop further price depreciation. Why? Because traders have submitted enough buy orders at that level to purchase the asset at a discount. Opposite of that, we have <strong>resistance</strong>. This tool acts as another barrier that stops the further rise of a listed asset. </p>\n<p>Support and resistance can be used to identify 3 things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possible reversals</li>\n<li>Entry points into a trending market</li>\n<li>Stop-loss and target zones in trending markets</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"identify-entry-points-based-on-support-and-resistance\">Identify Entry Points Based on Support and Resistance</h3>\n<p>If we suppose that an upward trending market will continue, we can find a previous high point (which acted as resistance) that was later broken during an impulsive move. That high now becomes support after a market pullback. If the price drops to that area and rebounds back up, the zone can be considered support. </p>\n<p>Let’s look at a simple chart showing this concept on an upward market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2b0ecb21ae.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>We apply the opposite approach in a downtrend market if we expect the bearish trend to continue. We are looking for a low point that acted as support just before a pullback to find these zones. After the price rebounded back up from the support zone, the downtrend continued, the previous low point was broken, and a new low was set. We then witness a second pullback after an impulsive move. The price shoots back up to the zone that acted as a support. However, this area has now become resistance causing the market to reverse and continue the downtrend.  </p>\n<p>This is how it looks like on a TradingView graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_7fb0dd5c6f.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>Identifying these areas of interest makes it easier to set buy or sell orders in a trending market. That&#39;s because we now have a good idea of how the price action will continue.</p>\n<p>Suppose you have successfully recognized support and resistance in an upward market. In that case, you know the area beyond which the price will not fall. You can set your buy order in this support zone with a stop-loss slightly under it just in case the price drops further before it rebounds. By now, you have learned that in a bullish (uptrend) market, the lowest point of the pullback can’t close below the low point of the previous pullback. If that is still the case, the current trend will likely continue, and a new high will be broken. If you are a trader, your target zone where you take profits could be in the area of the previous high.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_9a7f67525f.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>TradingView is the most popular charting tool in the world. Candlesticks are the main components of any professional graph. Based on the candle movements and patterns, it’s possible to determine what direction a market is taking. The two most common scenarios are upward and downward trends.</p>\n<p>By identifying zones in a trending market that act as support and resistance, we will understand what to expect next and apply our trading strategy. If the goal is to trade profitably, we can use this knowledge to set a realistic target zone where we intend to sell and a stop-loss limit to protect us from significant upsets.    </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-04-15T09:40:41.777Z","createdAt":"2022-04-15T09:40:40.751Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-20T11:58:48.803Z"},{"id":1122,"title":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet","description":"Users can now export private keys with the new version of NOW Wallet.","slug":"private-keys-export-feature-added-to-now-wallet","metaTitle":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet ","metaDescription":"Users can now export private keys with the new version of NOW Wallet.","featuredImage":{"id":4573,"name":"Private keys export-02.png","alternativeText":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet ","caption":"","hash":"Private_keys_export_01_123981538f","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Signing transactions and proving ownership of blockchain addresses require private keys.

Read our article to find out what staking is all about, so you can take advantage of this concept to earn rewards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-staking\">What Is Staking?</h2>\n<p>A short definition of staking states it is the process of holding coins for your mining pool. </p>\n<p>Staking is a process where users hold funds in their accounts to support a blockchain network. When you hold coins, you can receive rewards from your blockchain. Staking, therefore, allows users to earn rewards with their crypto holdings. It has become a popular way for investors to earn a passive income, due to the higher interest rates that it generates. The income earned through the rates being generated is sometimes even higher than you would earn with a savings account – making it a great alternative to traditional investments.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/02_17_Staking_101_1_01_a1320160c8.png\" alt=\"Staking Explained: All You Need to Know\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-staking-work\">How Does Staking Work?</h2>\n<p>Staking uses a proof-of-stake model, meaning that crypto users can lock in (or pledge) their coins for some time. The proof-of-stake consensus algorithm allows for a large number of transactions to be processed at a time and uses less cost per transaction than regular models. </p>\n<p>The staking period can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the type of cryptocurrency you are staking. Users cannot withdraw their coins or do any transactions during this period. If you do transact, you will lose out on your interest similar to traditional investments. </p>\n<p>Staking works through various cryptocurrency exchanges. You get to choose the amount you want to stake, although some cryptocurrencies may require you to stake a particular amount. However, you can pull out your stake if you change your mind (unstake your coins). You don’t “lose” your coins when you choose to unstake – they remain in your wallet and you can trade them as usual, later on.</p>\n<p>You can become a validator by pledging coins. A validator is someone who is chosen to verify transactions on a blockchain network. Although this is randomly chosen, the more coins you invest, the better chance you have of being chosen as a validator. </p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-staking\">Benefits of Staking</h2>\n<p>Staking serves as a great alternative to banking investments, with far less risk. </p>\n<p>The process uses a proof-to-take algorithm, using less energy than regular mining which uses a proof-of-work model.</p>\n<p>It’s an easy way to earn interest on your coins, with no equipment or tools needed. When you stake and become a validator, you help to ensure the security of the entire blockchain by </p>\n<p>supporting it as a whole. You can earn more than 20% interest in a year, depending on the crypto you are staking. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-stake-crypto\">How to Stake Crypto</h2>\n<p>Are you ready to stake? The process of staking can be overwhelming at first, but with time and practice, you can earn rewards easily. If you need help getting started, don’t panic, here’s an easy step-by-step guide to help you get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choose-a-cryptocurrency\">Choose a cryptocurrency</h3>\n<p>Look for a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and buy your <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies\">coins</a>. You can only stake with crypto that supports this model. It’s also possible to use a crypto trading platform to buy these coins. Before you choose a coin, it is recommended that you do your research to see which coin fits your budget and needs. Crypto can be unpredictable, but it’s a great long-term investment. Even if you choose not to use your coins for staking, they can be used to buy and sell assets. This means you need to choose a currency that is going to be worth your time and money.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t know which coin to invest in? Here’s a list to help you decide which crypto to choose:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ethereum has the highest crypto value after Bitcoin, making it a great investment. It’s affordable and is considered one of the most fluid liquid assets in crypto. Staking and Ethereum usually go hand-in-hand due to their popularity and lower inflation rates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/cardano\">Cardano</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cardano is more energy-efficient than most crypto. It’s also low-priced and a favorite with investors due to it being more programmable than Bitcoin. Staking investors use Cardano for its lower costs, making it popular and environmentally friendly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/polkadot\">Polkadot</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Polkadot works on multiple blockchains. It allows data and tokens to be transferred along with blockchains, making it a fast-growing crypto among investors. Polkadot is expected to do well as many high-end investors are now starting to invest in the coin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/solana\">Solana</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to its low fees, Solana is considered good crypto to invest in. It is the closest to Ethereum when it comes to speed and affordability. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/terra\">Terra</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Terra is a stablecoin that is cheap and allows for quick and easy transactions. Terra’s suite of stablecoins include US pegged TerraUSD (UST) and other coins pegged to the Euro, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tezos\">Tezos</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tezos is an environmental blockchain. It uses the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and is considered to be one of the most secure cryptos. Tezos has gained popularity due to the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFT) in gaming networks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choose-a-blockchain-wallet\">Choose a blockchain wallet</h3>\n<p>Once you buy your coins, you need to transfer them to a crypto or blockchain wallet. Depending on the platform you use, you can probably stake directly through the exchanges. In most cases, you will have to move your funds to a wallet. Crypto wallets help you to safely store your coins. Wallets are available to download, or you can use them on <a href=\"https://www.cryptowisser.com/8-best-crypto-affiliate-programs-in-2022\">crypto affiliate programs</a> or platforms. </p>\n<p>Staking is simple using ChangeNOW’s NOW Wallet app. The NOW Wallet does not collect any data and you can store funds on your device safely and securely. NOW Wallet keeps adding new cryptocurrencies and NFTs to the range so you can stake using crypto of your choice. It&#39;s worth mentioning that the app supports staking of BEP2 NOW tokens. You can <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">download NOW Wallet </a>to your device for easy transactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deposit-your-coins\">Deposit your coins</h3>\n<p>Once you have your wallet, it’s time to deposit. You can choose which crypto you prefer and deposit your coins. You will then be provided with a wallet address.</p>\n<h3 id=\"find-a-staking-pool\">Find a staking pool</h3>\n<p>After your funds are deposited, you can join a staking pool. A staking pool is a mining wallet where crypto traders combine their resources to earn better staking rewards. You need to do your research to decide which staking pool is best for you, and the crypto you want to stake. </p>\n<p><strong>Here are some tips when choosing a staking pool:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s best to choose a staking pool that has reasonable fees.</li>\n<li>Make sure there are no hidden fees.</li>\n<li>The staking pool should not crash and not be slow.</li>\n<li>Choose a pool that&#39;s not too small, as fewer investors can be risky.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start staking!</p>\n<p>Once you have found your pool, you are ready to stake it. Staking crypto can be done through your wallet. Simply choose the amount you want to stake to get started. You are now ready to earn rewards!</p>\n<h2 id=\"staking-tips\">Staking Tips</h2>\n<p><strong>Don’t be afraid to stake more if you have the funds available.</strong> If you aren’t going to use your crypto in the future, it is the best way to earn funds as it requires virtually no effort. </p>\n<p><strong>Do your research before you begin.</strong> Start by researching the different types of cryptos, as well as useful tips such as the ones provided in this article to help you make decisions. </p>\n<p><strong>Be patient.</strong> Staking is a long-term investment and as such, it requires time and patience on your part. Try not to pull out your stake unless you need the coins. The longer you stake, the better chance you have of earning a high reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Be careful of crypto projects with extremely high-interest rates.</strong> Sometimes this may be too good to be true, or it can be used as a tactic to get more investors on board. Staking rates can also quickly drop on these projects, which is why doing your research beforehand is essential.</p>\n<p><strong>Choose the exchange you are going to use for staking carefully.</strong> Most exchanges are going to make a commission off your stake, so choose the commission that works for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"should-you-choose-to-stake\">Should You Choose to Stake?</h2>\n<p>Staking is a trend that is here to stay. Today, staking is offered through many exchanges and cryptocurrencies. As rewards become available, more people are choosing to stake to earn a passive income. Investors around the world, as well as financial and retail institutions, will likely join in on the staking trend and find ways to work with crypto holders. </p>\n<p>Choosing to stake puts you ahead of the pack. You can earn rewards without doing much, and you can earn more interest per year than traditional investors. Although market rates may vary, it is essential to choose the crypto that works for you. Do your research before you stake to guarantee that you make a profit. As with all investments, staking takes time. If you have patience, the funds, and the discipline to earn rewards through long-term crypto investments, staking is a good investment. Like crypto trading, you should learn as much as you can about staking before you jump in. You can also use risk management to help you decide how far you are willing to go, and where to stop. </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":1,"name":"Academy","description":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.\n\n\n","slug":"academy","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Academy - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Everything you need to know about the world of crypto – basic concepts, foundational tech, renowned projects, and popular coins in NOW Academy.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}},{"id":4,"name":"Industry","description":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more. \n\n","slug":"industry","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Industry - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Keep up with the booming crypto industry – overviews, comparisons, useful guides, opinion pieces, and more.

One way or another, it’s a profitable sector and a prosperous industry.</p>\n<p>Even with ups and downs — that the whole cryptocurrency industry invariably goes through — savvy traders usually come out with a profit. One of the main challenges, even for experienced traders, is understanding how to calculate cryptocurrency profits.</p>\n<p>Because cryptocurrencies always go up and down, it’s crucial to diversify a portfolio. It usually makes sense to hold some of the largest and most popular cryptocurrencies, such as <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> (BTC), <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> (ETH), <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin-cash\">Bitcoin Cash</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ripple\">Ripple</a>, and several others. Alongside these, it is good to diversify as much as possible — aiming to benefit from new opportunities whenever they come along — such as ICO’s and IDO’s and therefore new coins and cryptocurrencies. </p>\n<p>Whether you are buying or selling, trading, swapping, exchanging or mining, it’s crucial to know how to calculate profits. In this article, we look at the easiest ways to do that, so that you can have a clear idea about how much profit you have made from every transaction. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-calculate-crypto-trading-profits\">How to calculate crypto trading profits</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, for those buying and selling cryptocurrencies, the basic principles of calculating profits are quite simple. There’s a price you buy the crypto for and the price you sell it at. </p>\n<p>Say you bought two Bitcoins (BTC) for $25,000 and you sell them for $35,000, then the Gross Profit is $10,000. With every crypto profit calculation, the first thing you need to do is know the number of coins you are buying and the price. Then when it comes to selling, you should note the number you are selling and the price at the time of that transaction. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ycWgz8aYgrJtKWrS5I0OKDomjvjK3r2vxHUiBoq5Rpq452rPYo09ozwc6JEnupnD-1xniI63hiIOsG2OiQfKmZnXqCLBApv4bJ4QyjdI3YXH4Q782wWTagbJ_Zxj3ijN7DNg1cQr\" alt=\"\" width=\"508\" height=\"304\"></p>\n<p>As you can choose to hold however much crypto, to keep in a portfolio or for a rainy day, you may not be selling as many as you bought. However, for the purposes of calculating profits, let’s assume you sell both BTC for $35,000, as per the example above. </p>\n<p>The profit you make isn&#39;t the full $10,000.</p>\n<p>There are always fees and other costs to consider, depending on the way you sell them, such as on an exchange. Every exchange — whether centralized or decentralized — charges different fees. </p>\n<p>Exchange fees can include any of the following, as described in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/faq\">ChangeNOW FAQs</a>: </p>\n<p>- Network fee for the deposit transaction from a customer&#39;s wallet;</p>\n<p>- Network fee for transferring coins to our liquidity provider;</p>\n<p>- Trading fees that our liquidity providers charge;</p>\n<p>- Network fee for sending the exchanged funds to the customer.</p>\n<p>Traders can buy, sell, and exchange crypto on ChangeNOW, and our policy and approach to these fees is to ensure we find the fastest and most user-profitable way to execute an exchange. It is crucial to us that the final amount you receive is as close to the estimate as possible. That&#39;s why we calculate all the possible fees for every transaction very thoroughly and include them in the estimate. </p>\n<p>Which means, with ChangeNOW, you are never going to be stung with high fees when buying and selling crypto. Regardless of the exchange and therefore the way you buy and sell crypto, there are always fees to consider. Other fees you are likely to encounter when trading cryptocurrency include gas fees, exit fees, and investment fees. </p>\n<p>So let’s say the average total of those accumulated and largely unavoidable fees are 3%, then you need to take that off the Gross Profit. Therefore, let’s apply that to the above example: </p>\n<p>Buy 2 x BTC = $25,000.00</p>\n<p>Sell 2 x BTC = $35,000.00</p>\n<p>Gross Profit = $10,000.00</p>\n<p>Fees: - 3% (of the total sale price) = $1,050.00</p>\n<p>Net Profit (Gross - Fees) = $8,950.00</p>\n<p>What if you are someone who trades a lot every day? Some traders are juggling dozens or hundreds or more transactions every day. Constantly buying and selling to benefit and profit from any number of micro price fluctuations. </p>\n<p>It would make sense to get a calculator specifically designed around the needs of crypto traders. A calculator, which pulls data in real-time from CoinMarketCap, to ensure you know how much has been gained or lost when transactions are happening, thereby keeping profit margins clear. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JT_HJ_MQ0rwgRUKxDhti2NNX-XKdfOSqZcHF4Wsubx7Y5dxKVE3AsIE2-hzUCyP_gyH8wBgxP3fBo5aEIW_B88r-T9LmGOldYOkEW1yTwFlr2hKfszoxN4NRgKqaxjAPfXmrwgRQ\" alt=\"\" width=\"427\" height=\"315\"></p>\n<p><em>South Korea is one of many countries seeking to tax crypto profits more effectively, according to</em> <a href=\"https://azcoinnews.com/south-korea-will-implement-a-20-tax-on-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-profits-starting-january-1-2022.html\"><em>AZCoin News</em></a><em>.</em> </p>\n<p>Here is another example of a handy, easy-to-use <a href=\"https://btc.feh.im/\">crypto profit calculator</a>. Having one of these open at all times makes it simple when it comes to working out the profits as you are trading. </p>\n<h2 id=\"calculating-exchanging-crypto-to-fiat-profits\">Calculating exchanging crypto-to-fiat profits</h2>\n<p>Because cryptocurrency is, at the end of the day, another form of currency, calculating the rate of exchange between any fiat currency and any crypto is fairly simple. In the same way that calculating the exchange rate between USD$ and Euros (EU€) can be done quickly and easily using Google Calculator and numerous other platforms and apps. </p>\n<p>Other ways to do this include the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/converter/\">CoinMarketCap calculator</a> and <a href=\"https://www.currexy.com/cryptocurrency/converter\">Currexy</a>, as a way of working out exchange rates between crypto and fiat currencies. Yet again, fees always need to be factored into the overall profits you come out with. </p>\n<p>When transferring from <a href=\"https://changenow.io/buy\">fiat to crypto</a>, or the other way round, there are always profits to be made. Providing you buy and sell at the right time. Knowing when to hold and when to sell is the key to making healthy profits. Once you&#39;ve calculated the relevant fees, depending on the exchange — whether centralized or decentralized — then you will have a Net Profit figure. </p>\n<h2 id=\"calculating-mining-profits\">Calculating mining profits</h2>\n<p>Mining cryptocurrencies or pre-ICO or IDO tokens is somewhat different than simply buying and selling already established cryptocurrencies. You can of course do that too, and millions of people do. Mining Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto’s is a route to generating profits, but it isn&#39;t as easy and requires more investment than simply buying and selling cryptocurrency. </p>\n<p>There are two ways to approach this. You can either mine an already established cryptocurrency, or you can stake (which means make a small investment) and offer to mine a pre-ICO or IDO token, which means one that hasn&#39;t launched. This does make it potentially more risky, especially before lock-in periods end, the tokens are available and compatible with exchanges, and you can start selling/exchanging these coins for other cryptocurrencies.  </p>\n<p>When mining any cryptocurrency or coin, there are a number of initial and ongoing costs to think about first. Long before any profits are generated. </p>\n<p>Firstly, you need a powerful computer or rig. The more powerful the better, and therefore, more expensive. You need one with as much hashing power as possible. </p>\n<p>Ongoing costs include the power consumption in watts, running costs for every kWh, total electricity costs, and then pool fees. Plus, if you are mining a pre-ICO or IDO token, then you usually have a staked and locked-in minimum investment required (either in fiat or another cryptocurrency). </p>\n<p>Once you’ve deducted all of those costs, then you will have a profit. One of the best ways to work this out is to use the <a href=\"https://btc.com/tools/mining-calculator\">BTC.com</a> Mining Calculator, or <a href=\"https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=70&amp;HashingUnit=TH%2Fs&amp;PowerConsumption=1500&amp;CostPerkWh=0.12&amp;MiningPoolFee=1\">CryptoCompare Calculator</a>.

Although crypto largely operates outside of the traditional financial services sector, most governments and tax collection agencies recognize it as a form of taxable income. </p>\n<p>Consequently, you need to work out how much tax is likely to be payable on profits so you can start setting it aside. You can get an understanding on this based on a number of factors. Ultimately, it always pays to speak with an accountant. Like with any business or income generating activity, profits are also offset by any losses, and of course costs encountered in the process of earning the top-line figure. </p>\n<p>How much you are taxed also depends on where you reside most of the time (and tax rates in that country), where any legal entities are registered, and a wide number of other factors. You can read more on crypto taxes in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/how-is-cryptocurrency-taxed-in-2021-and-what-you-need-to-know\">How Is Crypto Taxed in 2021</a>.</p>\n<p>Making sure you understand the profits on crypto mining, investing, buying, and selling is fairly easy to calculate. As long as you deduct all relevant costs, then profits are simple to figure out. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Are you looking to invest in cryptocurrency, or implement fast and safe crypto swaps?</em></strong></p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW</a>, you can <a href=\"https://changenow.io/buy\">buy cryptocurrency</a> with a credit or debit card, and sell or <a href=\"https://changenow.io/exchange\">swap currencies</a>, and exchange whatever you’ve swapped back into fiat currency, if you want.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\"><em>ChangeNOW</em></a> <em>does not provide investment advice.

There are many different blockchain networks on the market;  some of them are faster, while others have longer confirmation time. To understand how the process works, we’ll take Bitcoin as an example.</p>\n<p><strong>How does a Bitcoin transaction get confirmed?</strong></p>\n<p>When a Bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the network, it gets propagated to network participants responsible for verifying the transaction history and securing the network. These individuals are known as Bitcoin nodes. After successful verification, the transaction is sent to the mempool (or memory pool). The mempool is where all unconfirmed transactions wait to get picked up by miners and included in a new block. When your transaction gets selected and becomes a part of the next block, it receives its first confirmation and is considered confirmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is there a waiting time for confirmations?</strong> </p>\n<p>Bitcoin has a network difficulty setting, which dictates that each new block will be mined 10 minutes after the last one on average. Even if you paid the highest possible fee, you must still wait for the following block to be mined. When selecting which transactions to include in the next block, miners will always select those paying the biggest fees. Why? Because the fees are a part of their mining reward rate.</p>\n<p>Once an issued transaction is successfully added to a created block, it automatically receives a confirmation. The number of confirmations a transaction goes through is dependent on a number of factors. By a general rule of thumb,  the larger the amount of Bitcoin you transact, the greater the number of necessary transactions. </p>\n<p>While 1 or 2 confirmations are usually enough for payments less than $1000, as much as  6 to 10 confirmations are required for transactions above $10,000 and above sixty for payments more than a million dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>How to select an appropriate fee?</strong>  </p>\n<p>If you are in a hurry and want a quick confirmation, you should pay a higher network fee. If your transaction is not urgent, you can select a lower one. Each Bitcoin transaction has a size denominated in vMBs (virtual Megabytes). Miners prefer transactions with a higher fee rate. A fee rate is a number of satoshis (smallest bitcoin unit) the sender is ready to pay per vByte.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin wallets, such as <a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">NOW Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://guarda.com/\">Guarda Wallet</a> or <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\">Atomic Wallet</a>, have a fee estimator in the software. That can be used when selecting the appropriate fees. </p>\n<p>To get a better overview of the current state of the mempool and a more precise fee estimator, we suggest using <a href=\"https://mempool.space/\">Mempool.Space</a>. Use the high priority suggestion when you need a quick confirmation, or stick with the low or medium priority estimations when your transactions aren’t time-sensitive. </p>\n<p><strong>How much time does a confirmation take?</strong></p>\n<p>Different blockchains have different transaction confirmation speed. Among popular cryptos, Bitcoin is one of the slowest networks. Check out the graph that reflects it’s confirmation time/fee relation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pisk1K44sQBw8n2R7xTi7WxK6JcW-XBL-qQ5BKJzw3m7kmAxhw1WYkVOsvXMY4YiabW707-jgu5u2Fq7NhQs8t3ZzyD5VTohx8MynixsdTIczn0s46NDPx6QQ5WwxQ\" alt=\"crypto transaction confirmation time\" ></p>\n<p><strong>Can ChangeNOW somehow lower the confirmation time for my transaction?</strong></p>\n<p>Not really. But remember that the higher the fee, the faster the transaction is confirmed.</p>\n<p><strong>My transactions are often stuck. What can I do about it?</strong></p>\n<p>You are probably using a poorly managed wallet. Try <a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">NOW Wallet</a> instead. </p>\n<p>We designed this lightweight mobile wallet so you can enjoy secure crypto storage in an intuitive interface. The wallet is available for Android and iOS devices and allows you to access your crypto 24/7.  In NOW Wallet, you can buy or store crypto together with 550+ other digital assets. We constantly increase the number of available coins and improve the wallet in general by adding new features such as staking, NFT storage, and many others.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I know my transaction is confirmed?</strong></p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/explorer\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://live.blockcypher.com\">this website</a> and check your transaction status using transaction ID. </p>\n<p><strong>I was exchanging on ChangeNOW and my transaction got stuck. What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://support.changenow.io/hc/en-us/requests/new\">address your problem</a> to our 24/7 tech support team. </p>\n<p><strong>Tips to Lower the Network Fees</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>  Don’t send <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> during high network congestion (unless it’s urgent) when the fees spike, causing difficulties in getting a quick confirmation. Congestions usually occur when the value of bitcoin rises or drops significantly. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>  Consolidate your small inputs (the different bitcoin transactions you received throughout times) into a single input during cycles when the transaction fees are low. The more inputs and outputs (the addresses you send to) your transaction has, the more you’ll have to pay in fees. Spending coins from 1 input requires much lower costs than spending from 5 different inputs, no matter the number of coins that are being transferred.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":7,"name":"Tech","description":"Long reads on the technical side of crypto and blockchain projects – both for tech-savvy and crypto novices.\n","slug":"tech","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Tech - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"Long reads on the technical side of crypto and blockchain projects – both for tech-savvy and crypto novices.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-02T11:06:04.356Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["tech"],"publishedAt":"2021-06-01T18:59:04.000Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:46.943Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-27T14:20:09.730Z"},{"id":513,"title":"Is ChangeNOW Legit?

The abundance of scams and overnight platforms offering exchange services for digital assets makes it difficult for users to distinguish legitimate services from frauds. One of the platforms that has received a lot of user attention is the ChangeNOW service. Just as most platforms on the market, it is sometimes supposed to be a scam. Yes, sudden lags in transaction times, exchange rate fluctuations and other technical difficulties often make users suspicious of crypto scam. Still, it is both important and relieving to remember such difficulties are always temporary and do not mean that the exchange in question does not provide trustworthy financial services. The given material will provide insights into the operations of ChangeNOW and try to answer the question of whether ChangeNOW is legit and the issue migrating on numerous forum boards as “is ChangeNOW trustworthy?”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-changenow\">What Is ChangeNOW?</h2>\n<p>ChangeNOW is a <a href=\"https://changenow.io/exchange\">crypto exchange</a> platform that has been operating since 2017, allowing users to swap various cryptocurrencies almost instantly. The current <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies\">list of crypto assets</a> presented on the platform includes almost 400 digital currencies. The exchange allows users to transfer their assets directly to both hardware and hot wallets with a number of valuable features and functions that make it popular among users. The service is largely available worldwide and provides support in 28 languages, making it widely available for the majority of the crypto community. Prompt support response times are usually provided in the official Telegram chat and various social media. At its core, ChangeNOW is a non-custodial exchange service that has no limits on operations conducted on its basis. The commissions fees provided on the platform are considered to be the mean average on the market, or standard for the industry, and stand at a reasonable level of 0.5%. However, the website contains a disclaimer, which makes it clear that exchange rate fluctuations can affect the rate. In addition to crypto asset payment channels, ChangeNOW offers users the chance to <a href=\"https://changenow.io/buy\">buy and sell cryptocurrencies</a> using their VISA or MasterCard credit or debit bank cards, making it quite convenient. As for rates, ChangeNOW works as an aggregator of cryptocurrency prices from leading trading platforms to form profitable exchange rates for its users based on the best price.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that ChangeNOW is more than just a crypto exchange service. At this point, the platform’s large ecosystem includes many products such as <a href=\"https://changenow.io/mobile-exchange\">mobile exchange app</a>, <a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">NOW Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://nowtracker.app\">NOWTracker</a>, <a href=\"https://nowpayments.io\">NOWPayments</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/crypto-loan\">NOWLoans</a>, <a href=\"https://nownodes.io\">NOWNodes</a>, Telegram Bot, etc. </p>\n<h2 id=\"is-changenow-legit\">Is ChangeNOW Legit?</h2>\n<p>The question of whether ChangeNOW is reliable has to be approached from the aspects of the information the service provides on its operations and the feedback it receives from users. When it comes to legitimacy, a legal entity established in a country with favorable crypto regulation is a good indicator of reliability, as it will allow any disaffected users to file official complaints in case of gross breach of conduct. The ChangeNOW official website provides all the necessary details on the legal address and registration information of the entity. The <a href=\"https://changenow.io/about\">information</a> provided states that the exchange is registered as CHN Group Limited. The company’s office is in the Seychelles at House of Francis, Room 303, Ile Du Port, Mahe, with a postal address at Newtonlaan 115, Utrecht, 3584 BH, Netherlands. Based on checks of the provided information, it is clear that ChangeNOW is a legitimate exchange and can be included in the list of reliable exchanges for operations. The fact that the company has been up and running since 2017 without significant disruptions is a good indicator of reliability. In addition, the official website provides information on downloads of the <a href=\"https://changenow.io/mobile-exchange\">ChangeNOW mobile app</a> and <a href=\"https://walletnow.app\">NOW Crypto Wallet</a>, which is in the tens of thousands. The number of visitors stated is also impressive, which would not have been so had the platform been unreliable. The platform is also known to be safe and has good security features, providing user funds with the benefit of never storing their funds on the platform. Such an approach automatically negates the risk of fraud or hacking attacks. In addition, internal security checks are triggered with mandatory <a href=\"https://changenow.io/faq/kyc\">KYC and AML</a> procedures in case users exhibit suspicious activity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"additional-key-features\">Additional Key Features</h2>\n<p>Legit exchanges boast popularity, because they provide their users with high quality services. Scam services of this type are usually made with minimal effort to quickly attract trusting users and steal their funds. The question posed by users “is ChangeNOW trustworthy” can be easily answered by a review of the main features and functions that the service provides. Among the features that attract users to ChangeNOW are its user-friendly interface, instant transfer times, reasonable exchange rates, lack of registration requirements, and high levels of customer service. And though the service does require KYC and AML in case of large transfers, that is more of a benefit that underscores its legitimacy. In addition, the abundance of listed assets of almost 400 cryptocurrencies and more than 13,000 trading pairs is evidence of the service’s strive to improve quality and usability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-feedback\">User Feedback</h2>\n<p>The user feedback available on various forums and chat boards provides insights into the types of complaints and reviews about the operation of the platform. The negative user reviews that can be found across the net are mostly related to technical issues that can be compiled into lag times on transaction processing, or slow response times from the <a href=\"https://support.changenow.io/hc/en-us\">ChangeNOW support team</a>. However, the majority of user comments are pretty positive and detailed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is logical to state that ChangeNOW is a legitimate service that has the corresponding attributes and great community reputation based on the level of service quality it provides.</p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":1,"firstName":"Yennie","lastName":"Geller","description":"","slug":"yenniegeller","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/yenniegeller","linkedIn":"","twitter":"","occupation":"Editor-in-chief","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Yennie","metaDescription":"Editor-in-chief","image":{"id":2479,"name":"Group 4227.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_4227_55ebba9516","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Group_4227_55ebba9516.png"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-16T14:12:19.208Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:42.441Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-02T11:06:04.356Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2021-02-19T15:31:15.000Z","createdAt":"2021-09-16T14:27:46.702Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-20T13:44:40.596Z"}],"mainPageDescription":{"id":1,"title":"ChangeNOW Blog","description":"Latest crypto-related news and long reads on blockchain tech, DeFi industry, crypto markets, and renowned coins.","metaTitle":"Crypto Blog & News | ChangeNOW Crypto Exchange","metaDescription":"Latest crypto currency news and long reads on blockchain tech, DeFi industry, crypto markets, and renowned coins."},"blogPost":{"id":1083,"title":"Theta (THETA) Review 2022","description":"Streaming services and video sharing platforms are taking up a significant portion of the global internet traffic.","slug":"theta-theta-review-2022","metaTitle":"Theta (THETA) Review 2022","metaDescription":"Streaming services and video sharing platforms are taking up a significant portion of the global internet traffic.","featuredImage":{"id":3664,"name":"02.15 Theta Network (THETA+TFUEL) Review 2022-01.png","alternativeText":"Theta (THETA) Review 2022","caption":"","hash":"02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_02_15_Theta_Network_THETA_TFUEL_Review_2022_01_7ee9967cca.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>As a result, companies such as YouTube increase their revenues every year.

The project aims to improve the quality of streamed content and decrease the viewer’s loading times. The network was created by San Francisco-based software company <strong>Theta Labs, Inc</strong>. in 2017 and raised <strong>$20 million</strong> in a token sale the same year.</p>\n<p>With the rise of streaming needs and increased interest in blockchain technology, the team behind the platform concluded that it would be best to combine these two technologies into a complete solution. </p>\n<p>The problem with modern video streaming is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The picture quality varies depending on your geographical location. Many parts of the word experience re-buffering and loading issues.</li>\n<li>The viewers want to consume 4k and 8k videos but can’t due to inefficient delivery systems. </li>\n<li>Because of centralized CDN setups, viewers and content creators reap little to no benefits from traditional platforms. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theta aims to solve this with its P2P and blockchain-powered delivery service that incentivizes all users (consumers and creators) to participate in the network.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viewers receive TFUEL cryptocurrency for watching videos and sharing their non-used bandwidth with the community. </li>\n<li>The decentralized nature of the system can guarantee the same viewing experience in all parts of the world.</li>\n<li>The cost of delivering streaming services is reduced because there is no need to purchase expensive hardware infrastructure. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theta is an open-source project suitable for various needs. It can host eSports, VR content, music, movies, and do live streaming. The network possesses smart-contract functionalities and allows developers to build their own decentralized applications and protocols. </p>\n<h2 id=\"theta-theta-team\">Theta (THETA) Team</h2>\n<p>Theta has two co-founders: <strong>Mitch Liu</strong>, the company CEO, and <strong>Jieyi Long</strong>, Theta’s CTO. Both developers worked together on THETA.tv and realized that a different approach to traditional video streaming was needed. </p>\n<p>The company’s blockchain team consists of 21 engineers, developers, and managers. In addition, Theta has dozens of investors, including popular venture funds and technology giants such as Sony or Samsung. </p>\n<p>This service provider shines when it comes to its advisory team. Several influential figures from Twitch, Microsoft, Sony, or Verizon are all official Theta advisors. However, the most notable one is <strong>Steve Chen</strong>, the co-founder of YouTube. Steve is a big fan of the project and believes it will disrupt the video industry by offering more superb image quality at lower prices. </p>\n<p>Last but not least, we should mention Theta’s partner network. Powerful names such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Lionsgate, NASA, Katy Perry, Chainlink, FailArmy, or the World Poker Tour are all cooperating with Theta in one way or another.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"theta-theta-roadmap\">Theta (THETA) Roadmap</h2>\n<p>The project’s roadmap can be found on the official website. Among the achievements for 2021, we will mention the following two feats: Theta is now supported by hardware wallet producer Ledger. And the beta version of an NFT marketplace called <a href=\"https://www.thetadrop.com/\">ThetaDrop </a>has been released and is being tested.    </p>\n<p>These are Theta’s plans for Q1 of 2022:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new digital asset will be released on the mainnet. <strong>TDROP</strong> is an NFT token created for liquidity mining.</li>\n<li>A cross-chain bridge between THETA and ETH will be made for DEX, NFT and dApp communication.</li>\n<li>Theta’s Elite Edge Nodes will have a feature to store NFTs in a decentralized manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The roadmap for Q2 of 2022 looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An NFT-based video platform with P2P video sharing is planned to be released as beta.</li>\n<li>Users will be introduced to a <em>Live experience video streaming platform</em>.</li>\n<li>Improvements are scheduled for Edge Streaming Nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"theta-theta-network\">Theta (THETA) Network</h2>\n<p>The Theta blockchain is based on Ethereum, and hence it’s a Proof-of-Stake (POS) coin. It supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens and smart contracts. The network uses a <strong>Multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerant</strong> consensus algorithm, which allows it to process around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf-Op-1peZI\">1.000 transactions per second</a>.</p>\n<p>Theta uses various nodes to protect its blockchain, verify transactions, and host video content. The first type is the validators, known as <strong>Enterprise Validator Nodes</strong>. As of February 2022, there are 16 validator nodes operated by Theta Labs and several renowned companies such as Google, Sony, Samsung, Binance, etc.</p>\n<p>Around 3.500 <strong>Guardian Nodes</strong> make up the 2nd part of the consensus group. And finally, there are over 130.000 <strong>Edge Nodes</strong> on the Theta blockchain. As the name might suggest, the guardians are responsible for safekeeping the blockchain if Validator nodes get hacked or start acting maliciously. Guardian Nodes also have double-checking responsibilities, and they inspect everything that Validator Nodes are doing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/photo_2022_02_18_12_56_08_c24aa5e50a.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2022-02-18 12.56.08.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>Edge Nodes provide computational power to relay videos on Theta’s decentralized content sharing and delivery platform. This service is known as <strong><a href=\"https://community.theta.tv/theta-edgecast/\">EdgeCast</a></strong>. EdgeCast’s decentralized nature doesn’t allow Theta to control, censor, or delete content uploaded to it. This is the exact opposite of what YouTube is doing.</p>\n<p>Besides censorship resistance, what else makes Theta different from centralized streaming networks? CDNs ensure that the videos you watch are delivered to you in good quality. If you live in the city, a data server provides that content to you. But data centers aren’t available in all places of the world, like deserts, wastelands, forests, Siberia, and less-developed regions in Africa and East Asia. </p>\n<p>The missing infrastructure causes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ByurH6sMKQ\">lag and a low-quality streaming experience</a> for viewers. Moreover, building and maintaining this infrastructure is costly. That’s where Theta’s blockchain comes into play. The platform incentivizes users to make their bandwidth and computational power available to Theta by creating <strong>The Global Cache</strong>. The streaming service is thus fully functional and non-dependent on Content Delivery Networks.  </p>\n<p>Instead of getting videos from CDNs, Theta users obtain them from peers who are part of The Global Cache network. You, as a viewer, have to pay a certain number of tokens to watch videos and become a content host yourself. But then someone else pays you, creating a circle of spending and earning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-tokens-of-the-theta-network\">The Tokens of the Theta Network</h3>\n<p>Theta uses a dual token system on its blockchain. <strong>THETA</strong> is used as a staking coin and an asset for security and network governance. The 2<sup>nd</sup> token is <strong>TFUEL</strong>, used for transaction fees, smart contract operations, and staking rewards. THETA has a maximum supply of 1 billion units, while TFUEL’s upper limit is 5 billion. TFUEL is a deflationary asset. All tokens used for transaction fees are permanently burned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-theta-and-tfuel-tokens\">How to Mine THETA and TFUEL Tokens?</h2>\n<p>Theta is a POS-based project, so it can’t be mined, but it can be staked. Staking is done via the official <a href=\"https://wallet.thetatoken.org/unlock/keystore-file\">Theta Web Wallet</a>. A minimum stake of <strong>1.000 THETA tokens</strong> is required to participate in the staking process. This allows the user to become a Guardian Node.</p>\n<p>Staking can be done on a PC or using the mobile version of the wallet, which is available for both iOS and Android devices. The rewards depend on the number of staked tokens and are paid out in Theta Fuel (TFUEL). You can withdraw your stakes when you are done, and the funds will be returned to your address within 48 hours. </p>\n<p>Edge Nodes who earn TFUEL by hosting and relaying videos can also participate in the staking process. By staking their Theta Fuel tokens, they become <strong>Elite Edge Nodes</strong>. The minimum deposit stake is <strong>10.000 TFUEL</strong>, and the max is capped at <strong>500.000 coins</strong>. The un-staking period can take up to 60 hours before the tokens are returned to your wallet. </p>\n<h2 id=\"tfuel-and-theta-token-price-prediction-2022\">TFUEL and THETA Token Price Prediction 2022</h2>\n<p>Since THETA officially started trading on exchanges, it has generated an ROI of over 2100%. 2021 was its best year performance-wise. From March until April 2021, THETA token price skyrocketed as it went from $3 to an ATH of almost $16 on 16 April 2021.

If they are correct, the token will be worth at least $1 in 2025, and the 5-year forecast shows a price of over $1.30.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gov.capital/crypto/theta-fuel/\">GOV Capital</a></strong> has even more faith in Theta Fuel. In the next 12 months, they predict a value increase to $0.70. Their technical analysis team believes that the price of TFUEL will cross the $1 mark in March 2023.
