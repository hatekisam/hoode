    "articleBody": "<p>As cryptocurrency trading and exchange platforms continue to grow in 2022, an increasing number of crypto investors are seeking out secure and seamless ways to store and move their money. One major disadvantage of many platforms is their limit on the number of coins they support. Some even come with high transaction fees that make it difficult for individuals with small businesses or startups to afford. Stellar (with its digital currency, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/stellar\">XLM</a>), met these challenges and raised the bar.  </p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/03_09_Stellar_review_01_1_c9aeda4d95.png\" alt=\"Stellar XLM Review 2022\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"stellar-in-2022\">Stellar in 2022</h2>\n<p>According to their <a href=\"https://www.stellar.org/\">website</a>, Stellar is designed to allow the world’s financial systems to work together under a single network. The importance of a single decentralized network like this is that it gives businesses the ability to connect to a global network exchange — giving them the power to grow and possibly help startup businesses get off the ground. With over 6.5 million individual accounts trading XLM under its platform, Stellar has proven to be vital in allowing even small businesses to access global markets. </p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at what Stellar is all about and the impact it’s having on crypto and businesses alike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-stellar\">About Stellar</h2>\n<p>The Stellar project was founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. It is a fork of the Ripple protocol, of which McCaleb is also a co-founder. Ripple is a blockchain digital payment network with its own cryptocurrency, XRP. It is used mainly by banks and financial institutions to confirm transactions. Stellar was created to be an open-source network that goes beyond banking institutions. The network focuses on providing individuals with a quick and affordable way of receiving cross-border payments and transfers. </p>\n<p>With Stellar, users can trade numerous forms of digital currency; it allows them to turn dollars and euros into tokens that can be used to trade around the world. The Stellar network has its own digital currency called Lumens. </p>\n<p>Other features of Stellar include:</p>\n<p>●        Instant global payments</p>\n<p>●        No pre-funding requirement</p>\n<p>●        Currency support</p>\n<p>●        Travel rule compliance</p>\n<p>●        Open source developer tools</p>\n<p>●        Reaches new geographies and users</p>\n<p>●        Low, flat fees</p>\n<p>●        XLM is for sale on all popular exchange platforms, for instance, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW</a></p>\n<p>Since its launch Stellar has processed more than 2 billion transactions worldwide. Stellar is said to operate over 1,000 transactions per second. As an open source network, it is not governed by any institution or agency and allows secure access and transfers. The network follows a blockchain system that allows for quick, energy-efficient, and seamless transactions with lower fees than most networks.</p>\n<p>Stellar’s value increases due to its numerous applications for institutions and investments, including: </p>\n<h3 id=\"stellar-for-fintech-applications\"><strong>Stellar for Fintech applications</strong></h3>\n<p>Stellar provides Fintech companies with reliable and affordable global payment systems. It’s designed to make payments with international currency easier for all individuals involved. The platform offers features to these companies such as global access to USDC and other stablecoins, easy onboarding for wallets, new cash-out destinations, and access to additional financial products to help small businesses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stellar-for-remittances\"><strong>Stellar for remittances</strong></h3>\n<p>Stellar’s design makes it simple to send quick and affordable cross-border payments. This helps businesses expand their reach and access the global financial system. When a company becomes an anchor or uses an existing anchor, it’ll benefit from the speed that comes with using Stellar, real-time transactions, and currency support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stellar-team\">Stellar Team</h2>\n<p>Stellar was created by a team of <a href=\"https://www.stellar.org/foundation/team?locale=en\">expert developers</a>. The brilliant minds behind Stellar include co-founder and chief scientist David Mazières and Jed McCaleb, who created the network as an inclusive global marketplace for individuals and institutions around the world. </p>\n<p>Stellar software checks ledgers to ensure that the correct balances are reflected in accounts and that each individual confirms the transactions. The reason behind this approach is that Stellar remains committed to being independent of third-party interference. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-stellar-network\">The Stellar Network</h2>\n<p>The Stellar network operates using its digital currency XLM, and you’ll need a few to open your account and start trading. Stellar provides end-users with a fast and efficient network for trading and spending digital forms of money including euros, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, dollars, Mexican pesos. The open financial infrastructure was created by developers so that no special permissions or applications are needed to access it. Issuers simply deposit or redeem tokens. It also allows financial institutions to issue tokens without the need for third-party applications or <a href=\"https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar?locale=en\">associations.</a> </p>\n<p>Stellar uses a monetary policy, much similar to Ripple for producing XLM. The network initially minted 100 billion XLM tokens at the network’s launch. A small portion of those tokens was then distributed to the public via various giveaways such as airdrops. New XLM is issued via a 1 percent annual inflation rate that accrues proportional to participation in the inflation voting process. The current circulating supply of XLM is just over 19 billion, and the total supply is just under 105 billion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-stellar\">How to Mine Stellar</h2>\n<p>Stellar does not use the Proof-of-Work model which means it cannot be mined like Bitcoin. As of July 2021, around 20 billion XLM are held by users in the network. The other 30 billion are retained by the Stellar Foundation to help them to develop and promote the network. Stellar’s currency, however, entered the market for users to <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/stellar-lumens-xlm-explained-5194038\">purchase</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stellar-2022-price-prediction\">Stellar 2022 Price Prediction</h2>\n<p>Stellar is predicted to do well in 2022 even with market fluctuations, due to the increase in crypto users, and the many benefits it brings. The Stellar price is predicted to reach $0.29, with the anticipated high being around <a href=\"https://www.analyticsinsight.net/xlm-price-prediction-2022/\">$0.30</a>.  </p>\n<p>Wallet Investor predicts Stellar to be a profitable investment option for the year. Stellar Lumens can go up from $0.233 USD to $0.351 <a href=\"https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/stellar-lumens-prediction\">within a year</a>. They predict a long-term increase, along with a 5-year investment with the revenue that is expected to be around +249.36%.</p>\n<p>Trading Beast sees similar profitable outcomes for those looking to invest. The Stellar price on the <a href=\"https://tradingbeasts.com/price-prediction/stellar\">website</a> is forecasted to reach $0.3055824 by September 2022. While <a href=\"https://gov.capital/crypto/stellar-lumens/\">Gov Capital </a>predicts a lower profit of $0.50238922446108 after a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-buy-and-trade-stellar\">How Can I Buy and Trade Stellar?</h2>\n<p>Stellar Lumens can be traded on several cryptocurrency exchanges and stored in software and hardware wallets. Here are some popular platform suggestions to buy and trade stellar:</p>\n<h3 id=\"stellar-wallets\">Stellar Wallets</h3>\n<p>There are numerous third parties that have apps that help you interact with the Stellar network.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/stellar-wallet\">Atomic Wallet</a> – an advanced and secure cryptocurrency wallet to store XLM</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://trustwallet.com/stellar-wallet/\">Trust Wallet</a> – a mobile wallet app that is compatible with various blockchains</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">NOW Wallet</a> – safe non-custodial mobile wallet with 400+ available assets</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stellar-crypto-exchanges\">Stellar Crypto Exchanges</h3>\n<p>Stellar Lumens can be purchased from the secure and reliable ChangeNOW instant exchange platform, along with a wide range of digital cryptocurrencies.

One major disadvantage of many platforms is their limit on the number of coins they support. Some even come with high transaction fees that make it difficult for individuals with small businesses or startups to afford. Stellar (with its digital currency, <a href="../../currencies/stellar/">XLM</a>), met these challenges and raised the bar. </p>
<p> <img src="../../content-api-sub/uploads/03_09_Stellar_review_01_1_c9aeda4d95.png" alt="Stellar XLM Review 2022"></p>
<h2 id="stellar-in-2022">Stellar in 2022</h2>
<p>According to their website, Stellar is designed to allow the world’s financial systems to work together under a single network. The importance of a single decentralized network like this is that it gives businesses the ability to connect to a global network exchange — giving them the power to grow and possibly help startup businesses get off the ground. With over 6.5 million individual accounts trading XLM under its platform, Stellar has proven to be vital in allowing even small businesses to access global markets. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what Stellar is all about and the impact it’s having on crypto and businesses alike.</p>
<h2 id="about-stellar">About Stellar</h2>
<p>The Stellar project was founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. It is a fork of the Ripple protocol, of which McCaleb is also a co-founder. Ripple is a blockchain digital payment network with its own cryptocurrency, XRP. It is used mainly by banks and financial institutions to confirm transactions. Stellar was created to be an open-source network that goes beyond banking institutions. The network focuses on providing individuals with a quick and affordable way of receiving cross-border payments and transfers. </p>
<p>With Stellar, users can trade numerous forms of digital currency; it allows them to turn dollars and euros into tokens that can be used to trade around the world. The Stellar network has its own digital currency called Lumens. </p>
<p>Other features of Stellar include:</p>
<p>● Instant global payments</p>
<p>● No pre-funding requirement</p>
<p>● Currency support</p>
<p>● Travel rule compliance</p>
<p>● Open source developer tools</p>
<p>● Reaches new geographies and users</p>
<p>● Low, flat fees</p>
<p>● XLM is for sale on all popular exchange platforms, for instance, <a href="/">ChangeNOW</a></p>
<p>Since its launch Stellar has processed more than 2 billion transactions worldwide. Stellar is said to operate over 1,000 transactions per second. As an open source network, it is not governed by any institution or agency and allows secure access and transfers. The network follows a blockchain system that allows for quick, energy-efficient, and seamless transactions with lower fees than most networks.</p>
<p>Stellar’s value increases due to its numerous applications for institutions and investments, including: </p>
<h3 id="stellar-for-fintech-applications"><strong>Stellar for Fintech applications</strong></h3>
<p>Stellar provides Fintech companies with reliable and affordable global payment systems. It’s designed to make payments with international currency easier for all individuals involved. The platform offers features to these companies such as global access to USDC and other stablecoins, easy onboarding for wallets, new cash-out destinations, and access to additional financial products to help small businesses.</p>
<h3 id="stellar-for-remittances"><strong>Stellar for remittances</strong></h3>
<p>Stellar’s design makes it simple to send quick and affordable cross-border payments. This helps businesses expand their reach and access the global financial system. When a company becomes an anchor or uses an existing anchor, it’ll benefit from the speed that comes with using Stellar, real-time transactions, and currency support.</p>
<h2 id="stellar-team">Stellar Team</h2>
<p>Stellar was created by a team of expert developers. The brilliant minds behind Stellar include co-founder and chief scientist David Mazières and Jed McCaleb, who created the network as an inclusive global marketplace for individuals and institutions around the world. </p>
<p>Stellar software checks ledgers to ensure that the correct balances are reflected in accounts and that each individual confirms the transactions. The reason behind this approach is that Stellar remains committed to being independent of third-party interference. </p>
<h2 id="the-stellar-network">The Stellar Network</h2>
<p>The Stellar network operates using its digital currency XLM, and you’ll need a few to open your account and start trading. Stellar provides end-users with a fast and efficient network for trading and spending digital forms of money including euros, <a href="../../currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, dollars, Mexican pesos. The open financial infrastructure was created by developers so that no special permissions or applications are needed to access it. Issuers simply deposit or redeem tokens. It also allows financial institutions to issue tokens without the need for third-party applications or associations. </p>
<p>Stellar uses a monetary policy, much similar to Ripple for producing XLM. The network initially minted 100 billion XLM tokens at the network’s launch. A small portion of those tokens was then distributed to the public via various giveaways such as airdrops. New XLM is issued via a 1 percent annual inflation rate that accrues proportional to participation in the inflation voting process. The current circulating supply of XLM is just over 19 billion, and the total supply is just under 105 billion.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-mine-stellar">How to Mine Stellar</h2>
<p>Stellar does not use the Proof-of-Work model which means it cannot be mined like Bitcoin. As of July 2021, around 20 billion XLM are held by users in the network. The other 30 billion are retained by the Stellar Foundation to help them to develop and promote the network. Stellar’s currency, however, entered the market for users to purchase.</p>
<h2 id="stellar-2022-price-prediction">Stellar 2022 Price Prediction</h2>
<p>Stellar is predicted to do well in 2022 even with market fluctuations, due to the increase in crypto users, and the many benefits it brings. The Stellar price is predicted to reach $0.29, with the anticipated high being around $0.30. </p>
<p>Wallet Investor predicts Stellar to be a profitable investment option for the year. Stellar Lumens can go up from $0.233 USD to $0.351 within a year. They predict a long-term increase, along with a 5-year investment with the revenue that is expected to be around +249.36%.</p>
<p>Trading Beast sees similar profitable outcomes for those looking to invest. The Stellar price on the website is forecasted to reach $0.3055824 by September 2022. While Gov Capital predicts a lower profit of $0.50238922446108 after a year.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-buy-and-trade-stellar">How Can I Buy and Trade Stellar?</h2>
<p>Stellar Lumens can be traded on several cryptocurrency exchanges and stored in software and hardware wallets. Here are some popular platform suggestions to buy and trade stellar:</p>
<h3 id="stellar-wallets">Stellar Wallets</h3>
<p>There are numerous third parties that have apps that help you interact with the Stellar network.</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic Wallet – an advanced and secure cryptocurrency wallet to store XLM</li>
<li>Trust Wallet – a mobile wallet app that is compatible with various blockchains</li>

One major disadvantage of many platforms is their limit on the number of coins they support. Some even come with high transaction fees that make it difficult for individuals with small businesses or startups to afford. Stellar (with its digital currency, <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/stellar\\\">XLM</a>), met these challenges and raised the bar.  </p>\\n<p> <img src=\\\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/03_09_Stellar_review_01_1_c9aeda4d95.png\\\" alt=\\\"Stellar XLM Review 2022\\\" ></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"stellar-in-2022\\\">Stellar in 2022</h2>\\n<p>According to their <a href=\\\"https://www.stellar.org/\\\">website</a>, Stellar is designed to allow the world’s financial systems to work together under a single network. The importance of a single decentralized network like this is that it gives businesses the ability to connect to a global network exchange — giving them the power to grow and possibly help startup businesses get off the ground. With over 6.5 million individual accounts trading XLM under its platform, Stellar has proven to be vital in allowing even small businesses to access global markets. </p>\\n<p>Let’s take a look at what Stellar is all about and the impact it’s having on crypto and businesses alike.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"about-stellar\\\">About Stellar</h2>\\n<p>The Stellar project was founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. It is a fork of the Ripple protocol, of which McCaleb is also a co-founder. Ripple is a blockchain digital payment network with its own cryptocurrency, XRP. It is used mainly by banks and financial institutions to confirm transactions. Stellar was created to be an open-source network that goes beyond banking institutions. The network focuses on providing individuals with a quick and affordable way of receiving cross-border payments and transfers. </p>\\n<p>With Stellar, users can trade numerous forms of digital currency; it allows them to turn dollars and euros into tokens that can be used to trade around the world. The Stellar network has its own digital currency called Lumens. </p>\\n<p>Other features of Stellar include:</p>\\n<p>●        Instant global payments</p>\\n<p>●        No pre-funding requirement</p>\\n<p>●        Currency support</p>\\n<p>●        Travel rule compliance</p>\\n<p>●        Open source developer tools</p>\\n<p>●        Reaches new geographies and users</p>\\n<p>●        Low, flat fees</p>\\n<p>●        XLM is for sale on all popular exchange platforms, for instance, <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/\\\">ChangeNOW</a></p>\\n<p>Since its launch Stellar has processed more than 2 billion transactions worldwide. Stellar is said to operate over 1,000 transactions per second. As an open source network, it is not governed by any institution or agency and allows secure access and transfers. The network follows a blockchain system that allows for quick, energy-efficient, and seamless transactions with lower fees than most networks.</p>\\n<p>Stellar’s value increases due to its numerous applications for institutions and investments, including: </p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"stellar-for-fintech-applications\\\"><strong>Stellar for Fintech applications</strong></h3>\\n<p>Stellar provides Fintech companies with reliable and affordable global payment systems. It’s designed to make payments with international currency easier for all individuals involved. The platform offers features to these companies such as global access to USDC and other stablecoins, easy onboarding for wallets, new cash-out destinations, and access to additional financial products to help small businesses.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"stellar-for-remittances\\\"><strong>Stellar for remittances</strong></h3>\\n<p>Stellar’s design makes it simple to send quick and affordable cross-border payments. This helps businesses expand their reach and access the global financial system. When a company becomes an anchor or uses an existing anchor, it’ll benefit from the speed that comes with using Stellar, real-time transactions, and currency support.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"stellar-team\\\">Stellar Team</h2>\\n<p>Stellar was created by a team of <a href=\\\"https://www.stellar.org/foundation/team?locale=en\\\">expert developers</a>. The brilliant minds behind Stellar include co-founder and chief scientist David Mazières and Jed McCaleb, who created the network as an inclusive global marketplace for individuals and institutions around the world. </p>\\n<p>Stellar software checks ledgers to ensure that the correct balances are reflected in accounts and that each individual confirms the transactions. The reason behind this approach is that Stellar remains committed to being independent of third-party interference. </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"the-stellar-network\\\">The Stellar Network</h2>\\n<p>The Stellar network operates using its digital currency XLM, and you’ll need a few to open your account and start trading. Stellar provides end-users with a fast and efficient network for trading and spending digital forms of money including euros, <a href=\\\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\\\">Bitcoin</a>, dollars, Mexican pesos. The open financial infrastructure was created by developers so that no special permissions or applications are needed to access it. Issuers simply deposit or redeem tokens. It also allows financial institutions to issue tokens without the need for third-party applications or <a href=\\\"https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar?locale=en\\\">associations.</a> </p>\\n<p>Stellar uses a monetary policy, much similar to Ripple for producing XLM. The network initially minted 100 billion XLM tokens at the network’s launch. A small portion of those tokens was then distributed to the public via various giveaways such as airdrops. New XLM is issued via a 1 percent annual inflation rate that accrues proportional to participation in the inflation voting process. The current circulating supply of XLM is just over 19 billion, and the total supply is just under 105 billion.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"how-to-mine-stellar\\\">How to Mine Stellar</h2>\\n<p>Stellar does not use the Proof-of-Work model which means it cannot be mined like Bitcoin. As of July 2021, around 20 billion XLM are held by users in the network. The other 30 billion are retained by the Stellar Foundation to help them to develop and promote the network. Stellar’s currency, however, entered the market for users to <a href=\\\"https://www.thebalance.com/stellar-lumens-xlm-explained-5194038\\\">purchase</a>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"stellar-2022-price-prediction\\\">Stellar 2022 Price Prediction</h2>\\n<p>Stellar is predicted to do well in 2022 even with market fluctuations, due to the increase in crypto users, and the many benefits it brings. The Stellar price is predicted to reach $0.29, with the anticipated high being around <a href=\\\"https://www.analyticsinsight.net/xlm-price-prediction-2022/\\\">$0.30</a>.  </p>\\n<p>Wallet Investor predicts Stellar to be a profitable investment option for the year. Stellar Lumens can go up from $0.233 USD to $0.351 <a href=\\\"https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/stellar-lumens-prediction\\\">within a year</a>. They predict a long-term increase, along with a 5-year investment with the revenue that is expected to be around +249.36%.</p>\\n<p>Trading Beast sees similar profitable outcomes for those looking to invest. The Stellar price on the <a href=\\\"https://tradingbeasts.com/price-prediction/stellar\\\">website</a> is forecasted to reach $0.3055824 by September 2022. While <a href=\\\"https://gov.capital/crypto/stellar-lumens/\\\">Gov Capital </a>predicts a lower profit of $0.50238922446108 after a year.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"how-can-i-buy-and-trade-stellar\\\">How Can I Buy and Trade Stellar?</h2>\\n<p>Stellar Lumens can be traded on several cryptocurrency exchanges and stored in software and hardware wallets. Here are some popular platform suggestions to buy and trade stellar:</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"stellar-wallets\\\">Stellar Wallets</h3>\\n<p>There are numerous third parties that have apps that help you interact with the Stellar network.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://atomicwallet.io/stellar-wallet\\\">Atomic Wallet</a> – an advanced and secure cryptocurrency wallet to store XLM</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://trustwallet.com/stellar-wallet/\\\">Trust Wallet</a> – a mobile wallet app that is compatible with various blockchains</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://walletnow.app/\\\">NOW Wallet</a> – safe non-custodial mobile wallet with 400+ available assets</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"stellar-crypto-exchanges\\\">Stellar Crypto Exchanges</h3>\\n<p>Stellar Lumens can be purchased from the secure and reliable ChangeNOW instant exchange platform, along with a wide range of digital cryptocurrencies. Users can purchase XLM through a fixed rate flow while performing their exchange, which allows quick effortless crypto swaps that protect users against market volatility. </p>\\n<p>There are many other cryptocurrency platforms available for XLM. Some of these platforms include Binance, Crypto.com, Gate.io, and Bithumb.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"stellar-summary\\\">Stellar Summary</h2>\\n<p>Thanks to Stellar’s open-source and affordable trading rates, users across the world have access to fast and secure methods of transactions and cross-border payments. It has forever changed the crypto community and given access to start-ups and those from rural and undeveloped areas with fair and affordable access to digital payments.

Caution is advised when dealing with such addresses.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspicious</strong>: Addresses classified as suspicious may have some indicators of potential risks. Although not necessarily indicative of illicit activities, it is advisable to exercise caution and further scrutiny when engaging with these addresses.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Risk</strong>: Addresses labeled as medium risk suggest a moderate level of potential risk. While not as alarming as high-risk addresses, it is still prudent to proceed with caution.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Risk</strong>: Addresses categorized as low risk indicate minimal or negligible potential risk, providing a higher level of confidence in their legitimacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/status_check_8184fd9a67.png\" alt=\"status check.png\" ></p>\n<p>But that&#39;s not all!

It is an open-source network, which means that developers can build and launch their own decentralized applications using it. Solana initially emerged as a rival to the Ethereum (<a href=\"link\">ETH</a>) blockchain. Like the latter, it offers smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\n<p>Solana&#39;s other core features include its high speed, with the potential to process up to 65,000 transactions per second, and low transaction costs averaging at $0.00025. Transaction fees on Solana are in the network’s native token, <a href=\"link\">SOL</a>.</p>\n<p>The Solana coin is a utility token that functions as a medium of exchange and helps prop up security on the platform via staking. The project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former executive at Qualcomm, in 2017 and is currently run by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-solana\">A brief history of Solana</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-and-why-solana-was-created\">How and why Solana was created</h3>\n<p>Solana emerged in response to the scalability limitations of existing blockchain platforms such as <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BTC</a>) and Ethereum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Bitcoin price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believed that agreement on time was one of the biggest challenges of a distributed model.</p>\n<p>Yakovenko recognized that a reliable and accurate clock was crucial for network synchronization. As such, he began working on and developed the concept of <a href=\"link\">proof of history</a>. This technique allows for keeping time between untrusted computers, making network synchronization simpler and faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-exactly-is-solanas-proof-of-history\">What exactly is Solana’s proof of history?</h3>\n<p>The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism is Solana’s chosen technique to keep the time between computers that do not trust each other. The basic idea behind PoH is to use a &quot;timestamp&quot; that is generated by a central server and broadcast to all nodes on the network. This timestamp serves as a reference point for the network, allowing all nodes to agree on the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_26_18_PM_b5d4d80061.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.26.18 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"link\">Medium</a> </p>\n<p>To generate the timestamp, the central server creates a &quot;hash&quot; of a large amount of data (known as a &quot;PoH generator&quot;) and publishes it to the network. Each node on the network can then use this hash to verify the current time and sequence of events.</p>\n<p>The PoH generator is designed to be computationally expensive to create, ensuring it can only be generated by a central server and not by any individual node on the network. This helps to prevent any one node from manipulating the timestamp or the sequence of events.</p>\n<p>By using the PoH mechanism, Solana can achieve high levels of network synchronization and scalability, allowing it to process a large number of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement over other blockchain systems that lack a reliable clock and struggle to scale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-journey-to-the-solana-launch-yakovenkos-path\">The journey to the Solana launch: Yakovenko’s path</h3>\n<p>Solana was technically created in November 2017 when Anatoly Yakovenko published the whitepaper for the proof-of-history concept. This technique would serve as the foundation for the Solana project. With plans to weave all the world&#39;s transactions together on a single, scalable blockchain, Anatoly called it Loom.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald <a href=\"link\">published</a> the first open-source implementation of the PoH technique on GitHub under the name Silk. The project quickly gained traction, and the team continued to develop it.</p>\n<p>By March 2018, the team rebranded the project as Solana, a nod to the small beach town where Yakovenko and his team lived and worked. In June of that same year, they had scaled the technology to run on cloud-based networks. The next month, they published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second.</p>\n<p>After months of testing and development, the Solana mainnet went live on March 31, 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solana-price-evolution\">Solana price evolution</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-is-solana-worth\">How much is Solana worth?</h3>\n<p>Solana’s SOL token, like most cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price fluctuations. In the first few months after the launch, the Solana price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1.00.</p>\n<p>However, in late 2020, the price of Solana began to rise rapidly. Driven by the non-fungible token (NFT) hype and the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. SOL more than tripled to a peak of $18.00 in early 2021. Solana reached its all-time high of $258 in November 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Screen_Shot_2023_01_26_at_8_40_45_PM_ff2553a118.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 8.40.45 PM.png\" ></p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Solana price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these gains were nearly wiped out by the end of last year due to the crypto crash and subsequent contagion. Solana’s price took a hard hit from FTX’s implosion due to its close association with the exchange and subsidiaries. SOL dropped under $10 in late December for the first time since February 2021. However, it has recovered in the past month to trade at $24.22 currently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-solana-coins-are-there\">How many Solana coins are there?</h3>\n<p>The Solana foundation revealed that the total number of Solana (SOL) coins to enter circulation is 489 million. At the moment, 260 million tokens are available on the market. </p>\n<h3 id=\"where-can-you-buy-solana\">Where can you buy Solana?</h3>\n<p>Solana (SOL) can be purchased on a variety of exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and <a href=\"link\">ChangeNow</a>. With a user-friendly interface and a wide variety of payment options, ChangeNow makes it easy for anyone to purchase SOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanas-major-developments\">Solana’s major developments</h2>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2019\">Solana’s 2019</h3>\n<p>Right before the Solana mainnet launch, much of the team’s attention was on obtaining funding to develop its new crypto network. The project had already begun to gain traction.</p>\n<p>As such, the team was able to raise $20 million in a private token sale led by Multicoin Capital in Q1 2019. Other participants were Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2020\">Solana’s 2020</h3>\n<p>The year 2020 marked Solana’s emergence as the first blockchain to use proof of history. The platform launched on Mainnet Beta in March 2020, following successful fundraising and the launch of their public test network, Tour de SOL.</p>\n<p>That same year, <strong>Tether</strong> (<a href=\"link\">USDT</a>) launched Solana-native <strong>USDT</strong> and Circle partnered to make <strong><a href=\"link\">USDC</a></strong> a native stablecoin on the platform. Solana also held its first hackathon from October 28 to November 14.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Tether price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2021\">Solana’s 2021</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s 2020 hackathon and subsequent ones were a success, leading to an influx of developers and projects onto the platform. By December 2021, Solana had exceeded 1,000 projects and saw a significant rise in its price and daily active users. This propelled the SOL token to the fifth spot on the crypto list, surpassing <strong>Cardano</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<p>However, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for 17 hours. The platform had formerly gone down for 6 hours in December 2021, earning it a reputation for frequent outages.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest Cardano price <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"solanas-2022\">Solana’s 2022</h3>\n<p>Solana&#39;s outage problem persisted into 2022. Despite this, the network was able to make some progress. Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, announced integration with Ethereum and Polygon. In June, Solana revealed plans for the first crypto smartphone, the Solana Saga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/solana_saga_01_7aaaabbbc6.jpg\" alt=\"solana-saga_01.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>The platform also opened a physical store in New York City dedicated to all things crypto in July. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Solana_just_launched_a_physical_store_in_metaverse_79dcec4278.jpg\" alt=\"Solana-just-launched-a-physical-store-in-metaverse.jpg\" ></p>\n<p>Notably, Solana&#39;s NFT market experienced substantial growth in 2022, with the number of minted NFTs reaching 312,000 on September 7. Additionally, Solana NFT trading volumes rose to hit $11.5 million on September 6.</p>\n<p>However, in August, the platform&#39;s mobile wallet suffered a hack resulting in $8 million worth of losses. Thousands of Solana users suffered in the attack, which Solana ultimately blamed on a third-party platform, the Slope mobile wallet app. Solana experienced more losses later on as the FTX and Alameda saga caused the single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics as SOL dipped 96%. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solana-ecosystem\">The Solana ecosystem</h3>\n<p>The Solana ecosystem is home to a diverse range of projects, from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The platform’s speed, affordability, and scalability mean it is quickly becoming a go-to destination for developers, entrepreneurs, and users who want to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications and services. </p>\n<p>Among these projects are <strong>Phantom</strong>, a decentralized social network that empowers users to share content, earn rewards, and connect with others; <strong>Stepn</strong> (<a href=\"link\">GMT</a>), a platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows artists and creators to monetize their work. Solana also hosts <strong>Star Atlas</strong> (<a href=\"link\">ATLAS</a>), a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading digital assets, and <strong>Audius</strong>, initially built on Ethereum but moved to Solana in 2020, a decentralized streaming platform for musicians that enables them to control their music and earn royalties directly from fans.</p>\n<p>More recently, <strong>BONK</strong> (<a href=\"link\">BONK</a>),  “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people,” which was released in December 2020. </p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Like most other projects in the crypto industry, Solana reaped the benefits of 2021’s DeFi and NFT boom. In the same vein, it was unable to escape the impact of the crypto winter in 2022. Still, its attractive blend of speed and affordability, thanks to its unique technology, makes it a staple for most developers in this space. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Check the latest SOL trading pairs <a href=\"link\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Also Read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/blog/analyst-predicts-sols-price-prior-to-solanas-milestone-conference\">Analyst Predicts SOL’s Price Prior to Solana’s Conference</a></li>\n</ul>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":3,"name":"Coins","description":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","slug":"coin","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Coins - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"If you've been searching for an excellent comprehensive analysis or detailed reviews on cryptocurrencies – you've come to the right place.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":4,"firstName":"PK","lastName":"Daami","description":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","slug":"pkdaami","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/pkdaami","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto enthusiast","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Crypto enthusiast","metaDescription":"In love with NFTs and unusual metaverses","image":{"id":2654,"name":"01_author.jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Enthusiast","caption":"","hash":"01_author_1b4b0c8c84","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_01_author_1b4b0c8c84.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:21.079Z","createdAt":"2021-10-15T13:00:02.152Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:09.970Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["coins"],"publishedAt":"2023-01-26T19:28:00.275Z","createdAt":"2023-01-26T18:47:45.949Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-02T10:18:16.163Z"},{"id":1366,"title":"ChangeNOW stands against fraudulent actions amid Alameda wallets' suspicious activity","description":"Taking into account the company's high AML standards in terms of resistance to illegal activity, ChangeNOW is putting serious effort into preventing such incidents as the recent Alameda wallets’ case.","slug":"changenow-stands-against-fraudulent-actions-ensures-high-compliance-standards-amid-alameda-wallets-suspicious-activity","metaTitle":"ChangeNOW position amid Alameda suspicious activity","metaDescription":"The compliance team works round-the-clock with investigation inquiries related to Alameda funds movement","featuredImage":{"id":6782,"name":"12.28 Alameda Incident Statement-01.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_12_28_Alameda_Incident_Statement_01_242530bc7b.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Once fraudulent activity was first reported by investigators, the ChangeNOW compliance team responded immediately and blocklisted suspicious wallets.

One major disadvantage of many platforms is their limit on the number of coins they support. Some even come with high transaction fees that make it difficult for individuals with small businesses or startups to afford. Stellar (with its digital currency, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/stellar\">XLM</a>), met these challenges and raised the bar.  </p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/03_09_Stellar_review_01_1_c9aeda4d95.png\" alt=\"Stellar XLM Review 2022\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"stellar-in-2022\">Stellar in 2022</h2>\n<p>According to their <a href=\"https://www.stellar.org/\">website</a>, Stellar is designed to allow the world’s financial systems to work together under a single network. The importance of a single decentralized network like this is that it gives businesses the ability to connect to a global network exchange — giving them the power to grow and possibly help startup businesses get off the ground. With over 6.5 million individual accounts trading XLM under its platform, Stellar has proven to be vital in allowing even small businesses to access global markets. </p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at what Stellar is all about and the impact it’s having on crypto and businesses alike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-stellar\">About Stellar</h2>\n<p>The Stellar project was founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. It is a fork of the Ripple protocol, of which McCaleb is also a co-founder. Ripple is a blockchain digital payment network with its own cryptocurrency, XRP. It is used mainly by banks and financial institutions to confirm transactions. Stellar was created to be an open-source network that goes beyond banking institutions. The network focuses on providing individuals with a quick and affordable way of receiving cross-border payments and transfers. </p>\n<p>With Stellar, users can trade numerous forms of digital currency; it allows them to turn dollars and euros into tokens that can be used to trade around the world. The Stellar network has its own digital currency called Lumens. </p>\n<p>Other features of Stellar include:</p>\n<p>●        Instant global payments</p>\n<p>●        No pre-funding requirement</p>\n<p>●        Currency support</p>\n<p>●        Travel rule compliance</p>\n<p>●        Open source developer tools</p>\n<p>●        Reaches new geographies and users</p>\n<p>●        Low, flat fees</p>\n<p>●        XLM is for sale on all popular exchange platforms, for instance, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW</a></p>\n<p>Since its launch Stellar has processed more than 2 billion transactions worldwide. Stellar is said to operate over 1,000 transactions per second. As an open source network, it is not governed by any institution or agency and allows secure access and transfers. The network follows a blockchain system that allows for quick, energy-efficient, and seamless transactions with lower fees than most networks.</p>\n<p>Stellar’s value increases due to its numerous applications for institutions and investments, including: </p>\n<h3 id=\"stellar-for-fintech-applications\"><strong>Stellar for Fintech applications</strong></h3>\n<p>Stellar provides Fintech companies with reliable and affordable global payment systems. It’s designed to make payments with international currency easier for all individuals involved. The platform offers features to these companies such as global access to USDC and other stablecoins, easy onboarding for wallets, new cash-out destinations, and access to additional financial products to help small businesses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stellar-for-remittances\"><strong>Stellar for remittances</strong></h3>\n<p>Stellar’s design makes it simple to send quick and affordable cross-border payments. This helps businesses expand their reach and access the global financial system. When a company becomes an anchor or uses an existing anchor, it’ll benefit from the speed that comes with using Stellar, real-time transactions, and currency support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stellar-team\">Stellar Team</h2>\n<p>Stellar was created by a team of <a href=\"https://www.stellar.org/foundation/team?locale=en\">expert developers</a>. The brilliant minds behind Stellar include co-founder and chief scientist David Mazières and Jed McCaleb, who created the network as an inclusive global marketplace for individuals and institutions around the world. </p>\n<p>Stellar software checks ledgers to ensure that the correct balances are reflected in accounts and that each individual confirms the transactions. The reason behind this approach is that Stellar remains committed to being independent of third-party interference. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-stellar-network\">The Stellar Network</h2>\n<p>The Stellar network operates using its digital currency XLM, and you’ll need a few to open your account and start trading. Stellar provides end-users with a fast and efficient network for trading and spending digital forms of money including euros, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, dollars, Mexican pesos. The open financial infrastructure was created by developers so that no special permissions or applications are needed to access it. Issuers simply deposit or redeem tokens. It also allows financial institutions to issue tokens without the need for third-party applications or <a href=\"https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar?locale=en\">associations.</a> </p>\n<p>Stellar uses a monetary policy, much similar to Ripple for producing XLM. The network initially minted 100 billion XLM tokens at the network’s launch. A small portion of those tokens was then distributed to the public via various giveaways such as airdrops. New XLM is issued via a 1 percent annual inflation rate that accrues proportional to participation in the inflation voting process. The current circulating supply of XLM is just over 19 billion, and the total supply is just under 105 billion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mine-stellar\">How to Mine Stellar</h2>\n<p>Stellar does not use the Proof-of-Work model which means it cannot be mined like Bitcoin. As of July 2021, around 20 billion XLM are held by users in the network. The other 30 billion are retained by the Stellar Foundation to help them to develop and promote the network. Stellar’s currency, however, entered the market for users to <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/stellar-lumens-xlm-explained-5194038\">purchase</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stellar-2022-price-prediction\">Stellar 2022 Price Prediction</h2>\n<p>Stellar is predicted to do well in 2022 even with market fluctuations, due to the increase in crypto users, and the many benefits it brings. The Stellar price is predicted to reach $0.29, with the anticipated high being around <a href=\"https://www.analyticsinsight.net/xlm-price-prediction-2022/\">$0.30</a>.  </p>\n<p>Wallet Investor predicts Stellar to be a profitable investment option for the year. Stellar Lumens can go up from $0.233 USD to $0.351 <a href=\"https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/stellar-lumens-prediction\">within a year</a>.
