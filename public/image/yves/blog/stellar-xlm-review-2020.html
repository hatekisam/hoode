    "articleBody": "<p>Stellar is a decentralized blockchain-based project that aims to make money move like emails. Its network has attracted the remittances world to move towards a space in which the position of sovereign currencies declined in favor of virtual currencies. Since launching, Stellar was able to surprise the crypto community by its rapidly-rising partnerships and its cutting-edge tech that is developing day by day. In our all-embracing review to Stellar Lumens (XLM), we&#39;ll cover all XLM cryptocurrency aspects and give you a close insight into the XLM real value. Let&#39;s head into it. </p>\n<h4 id=\"what-is-stellar\"><strong>What is Stellar?</strong></h4>\n<p>Stellar Lumens (XLM), a crypto project that is establishing a global financial network. Launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, a former co-founder of Ripple and David Mazieres, a professor of Computer Science. Stellar creators see a lack in the billion-dollar global remittance industry when it comes to the small cross border transactions with the high fees and slow service. To introduce an effective and cheap solution for cross border payments and other financing issues, Stellar is primarily designed to be a distributed payments network that is meant to afford a cheap, fast, and secure cross-border payment solution. The network also can be used as an ICO platform for issuing tokens, which is easier to use when compared with Ethereum. In the stellar network, users can pay in different currencies; fiat, gold, and XLM with other users, and registering debts of trusted users on the decentralized ledger. When the payments are completed, the user&#39;s balance will be registered upon the ledger. When users who do not trust each other try to send assets, the network finds a way to start from the beginning to end-user by a network of trusted user pairs. When the payment is finished, all balances along the trust path are stabilized instantly and straightaway. </p>\n<h4 id=\"how-does-stellar-work\"><strong>How Does Stellar Work?</strong></h4>\n<p>Stellar is utilizing a network of decentralized servers and a distributed ledger that is updating every 2-5 seconds among whole nodes. Unlike Bitcoin, Stellar&#39;s network with it’s unique and high-effective consensus protocol that is known as the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm is able to process transactions too fast. The FBA algorithm relies on quorum slices (or a part of the network) to validate a transaction, wherein every node in Stellar&#39;s network decides another set of trustworthy (nodes). When a transaction is approved by all nodes inside this set, this means the transaction is confirmed. That&#39;s what has made the Stellar network greatly fast and able to process 1,000 operations per second.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-is-xlm\"><strong>What is XLM?</strong></h4>\n<p>XLM is the native and common currency of the Stellar network and has several use cases. The main use is for cheap and fast payments, you can start with creating your account with Stellar&#39;s network, and establish trust lines from your account to another account, in which payment fees (0.00001 XLM). Other uses of XLM such as a bridging currency for liquidity providing between users or entities who/which don&#39;t have a standard currency to complete exchanges. XLM coin also can be used for trading purposes like any other cryptocurrency asset. </p>\n<h4 id=\"stellar-vs-ripple\"><strong>Stellar vs. Ripple</strong></h4>\n<p>Both Stellar and Ripple are payment networks, were created by Jeb McCaleb, and are widely seen as competing networks. However, there are key differences between the two platforms. While some people falsely claim that Stellar is a fork of Ripple, but in fact, Stellar has its own unique code base, and the two have different philosophies. Ripple focuses on financial transactions in terms of the institutional side. It has sought partnerships with major global banks to replace global remittance networks. Stellar, on the other hand, is concerned more with individuals. It offers a platform that affirms inclusion and global financial literacy. After 5 years of development, Stellar has used a model known as Federated Byzantine Agreement to switch to the Stellar Consensus Protocol for its consensus mechanism, while Ripple remains with a protocol that uses a proof-of-correctness mechanism.</p>\n<h4 id=\"stellar-lumens-partnerships\"><strong>Stellar Lumens Partnerships</strong></h4>\n<p>Stellar mainly aims at helping unbanked people or who have low-income. Since its inception, the Stellar news has been revealing on new partnerships from time to time. Today, Stellar has plenty of strategic partnerships, the most important one with IBM, as the Stellar crypto news reported in 2017. The partnership aims to develop a cross-border blockchain-based payment system for large banks. Therefore, the efficiency of cross border transactions would be positively affected, especially for States of South-East Asia where many domestic helpers cannot afford to send money back home due to the remittance high cost. The program currently deals with 47 currencies and in 72 countries.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pros-and-cons-of-stellar\"><strong>Pros and Cons of Stellar</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>  A decentralized network and open-source code.</li>\n<li>  Transactions confirmation time: 2-5 seconds.</li>\n<li>  Thousands of transactions per second.</li>\n<li>  Fast, secure and inexpensive cross-border payments.</li>\n<li>  Stellar has plenty of partnerships and support from non-profit institutes</li>\n<li>  Enables Multi-signatures and Smart Contracts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>  The Crypto industry already has some tough competitors to stellar in its chosen space, such as Ripple, Ethereum, and other new alternatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"how-to-mine-xlm\"><strong>How to mine XLM?</strong></h4>\n<p>Indeed, you can&#39;t mine XLM coins in a similar process to Bitcoin as it doesn&#39;t use the Proof-of-Work mechanism. To illustrate, Bitcoin&#39;s mining process is going through 3 steps: 1) Creating BTC coins 2) Coins Distributing 3) Verifying transactions across a decentralized system. Instead, Stellar&#39;s creation can be only with a mechanism called &quot;inflation&quot;, whereas Stellar relies on re-established nodes that validate transactions across a voting system. The rewards of the block are given to Stellar Nodes at a 1% inflation rate per year. XLM coins also could be distributed to as many people worldwide as possible in a series of the Stellar airdrop processes or giveaways (free Stellar coins) defined in their mandate via a direct voting method. You can acquire Stellar coins by trading on exchanges, being a recipient of inflation voting, and/or through the Foundation&#39;s XLM airdrop and giveaway programs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"where-to-buy-xlm\"><strong>Where to Buy XLM?</strong></h4>\n<p>You can buy XLM through the crypto exchanges. Today, the majority of exchanges support trading XLM assets where you can get your XLM coins, but most of them allow you to buy/sell XLM only against BTC, USDT, and ETH. There are over 30 exchange platforms that provide XLM trading, the most popular ones are Binance, Bitfinex, HitBTC, Ethfinex, Coinegg, OKEx, Bit-Z, Huobi, etc.</p>\n<h4 id=\"buy-xml-with-changenow\"><strong>Buy XML with ChangeNOW</strong></h4>\n<p>You can buy XLM instantly with the <a href=\"https://Changenow.io\">ChangeNOW</a> instant exchange tool that provides you a fast, secure, and simple way to buy XLM coins. Our service supports both cryptocurrencies and fiat with several purchase options swiftly and safely with minimal authentication procedures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4-steps-to-buy-xlm-coins\"><strong>4 Steps to buy XLM coins:</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From the <strong>ChangeNOW home page</strong>, choose a currency and enter the amount you would like to deposit. The service will automatically calculate the amount of BAT you will get. Then click on the Exchange button. With the current example, buying XLM for 1,000 USD via Credit Card. <img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/image7_3_923_ddaa7ca363.png\" alt=\"\" > <strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter your XLM address (where you would like to receive your coins). <strong>Step 3.</strong> Double-check your information, then click <strong>Confirm</strong>. Remember that all operations are irreversible. <strong>Step 4.</strong> After you have confirmed the transaction, complete the purchasing process and you will receive your tokens immediately.</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-to-store-xlm\"><strong>How to store XLM?</strong></h4>\n<p>To store your XLM assets, choose a secure and reliable crypto wallet that supports the Stellar coin. You have a wide range of wallet options to store your XLM coins. But before you jump on a wallet, make sure it is compatible with XLM coins. You can pick one of our list for the best XLM wallets here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Trust Wallet,</strong> a secure, user-friendly wallet that supports a great variety of cryptocurrencies, available for Web, Android, and iOS.</li>\n<li>  <strong>LOBSTR, Curv, Ownbit and HTC Exodus</strong> are also proper wallets that support XLM cryptocurrency.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Cold wallets</strong> (wallets that are not connected to the internet) such as <strong>Trezor</strong> or <strong>L****edger Nano S</strong>, which provide secure offline storage of your cryptocurrency assets.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Exchanges&#39; wallets</strong> like Binance, HTC, Exodus, Gate.io, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\n<p>The future bears plenty of opportunities for Stellar, as well as some challenges. Among those challenges will be beating the competition in the arena it chooses from Ripple and other platforms such as OmiseGo. When it comes to its aspirations to be a crowdfunding platform, many more challenges may arise. The competition is not only against Ethereum but also now against new alternatives for crowdfunding such as the Binance Launchpad. However, Stellar is a tough competitor itself, with an impressive feature set and multiple partnerships, among the most noteworthy of which is the partnership with IBM that could help boost the fortunes of Stellar. </p>\n"

In our all-embracing review to Stellar Lumens (XLM), we&#39;ll cover all XLM cryptocurrency aspects and give you a close insight into the XLM real value. Let&#39;s head into it. </p>
<h4 id="what-is-stellar"><strong>What is Stellar?</strong></h4>
<p>Stellar Lumens (XLM), a crypto project that is establishing a global financial network. Launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, a former co-founder of Ripple and David Mazieres, a professor of Computer Science. Stellar creators see a lack in the billion-dollar global remittance industry when it comes to the small cross border transactions with the high fees and slow service. To introduce an effective and cheap solution for cross border payments and other financing issues, Stellar is primarily designed to be a distributed payments network that is meant to afford a cheap, fast, and secure cross-border payment solution. The network also can be used as an ICO platform for issuing tokens, which is easier to use when compared with Ethereum. In the stellar network, users can pay in different currencies; fiat, gold, and XLM with other users, and registering debts of trusted users on the decentralized ledger. When the payments are completed, the user&#39;s balance will be registered upon the ledger. When users who do not trust each other try to send assets, the network finds a way to start from the beginning to end-user by a network of trusted user pairs. When the payment is finished, all balances along the trust path are stabilized instantly and straightaway. </p>
<h4 id="how-does-stellar-work"><strong>How Does Stellar Work?</strong></h4>
<p>Stellar is utilizing a network of decentralized servers and a distributed ledger that is updating every 2-5 seconds among whole nodes. Unlike Bitcoin, Stellar&#39;s network with it’s unique and high-effective consensus protocol that is known as the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm is able to process transactions too fast. The FBA algorithm relies on quorum slices (or a part of the network) to validate a transaction, wherein every node in Stellar&#39;s network decides another set of trustworthy (nodes). When a transaction is approved by all nodes inside this set, this means the transaction is confirmed. That&#39;s what has made the Stellar network greatly fast and able to process 1,000 operations per second.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-xlm"><strong>What is XLM?</strong></h4>
<p>XLM is the native and common currency of the Stellar network and has several use cases. The main use is for cheap and fast payments, you can start with creating your account with Stellar&#39;s network, and establish trust lines from your account to another account, in which payment fees (0.00001 XLM). Other uses of XLM such as a bridging currency for liquidity providing between users or entities who/which don&#39;t have a standard currency to complete exchanges. XLM coin also can be used for trading purposes like any other cryptocurrency asset. </p>
<h4 id="stellar-vs-ripple"><strong>Stellar vs. Ripple</strong></h4>
<p>Both Stellar and Ripple are payment networks, were created by Jeb McCaleb, and are widely seen as competing networks. However, there are key differences between the two platforms. While some people falsely claim that Stellar is a fork of Ripple, but in fact, Stellar has its own unique code base, and the two have different philosophies. Ripple focuses on financial transactions in terms of the institutional side. It has sought partnerships with major global banks to replace global remittance networks. Stellar, on the other hand, is concerned more with individuals. It offers a platform that affirms inclusion and global financial literacy. After 5 years of development, Stellar has used a model known as Federated Byzantine Agreement to switch to the Stellar Consensus Protocol for its consensus mechanism, while Ripple remains with a protocol that uses a proof-of-correctness mechanism.</p>
<h4 id="stellar-lumens-partnerships"><strong>Stellar Lumens Partnerships</strong></h4>
<p>Stellar mainly aims at helping unbanked people or who have low-income. Since its inception, the Stellar news has been revealing on new partnerships from time to time. Today, Stellar has plenty of strategic partnerships, the most important one with IBM, as the Stellar crypto news reported in 2017. The partnership aims to develop a cross-border blockchain-based payment system for large banks. Therefore, the efficiency of cross border transactions would be positively affected, especially for States of South-East Asia where many domestic helpers cannot afford to send money back home due to the remittance high cost. The program currently deals with 47 currencies and in 72 countries.</p>
<h4 id="pros-and-cons-of-stellar"><strong>Pros and Cons of Stellar</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> A decentralized network and open-source code.</li>
<li> Transactions confirmation time: 2-5 seconds.</li>
<li> Thousands of transactions per second.</li>
<li> Fast, secure and inexpensive cross-border payments.</li>
<li> Stellar has plenty of partnerships and support from non-profit institutes</li>
<li> Enables Multi-signatures and Smart Contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> The Crypto industry already has some tough competitors to stellar in its chosen space, such as Ripple, Ethereum, and other new alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-mine-xlm"><strong>How to mine XLM?</strong></h4>
<p>Indeed, you can&#39;t mine XLM coins in a similar process to Bitcoin as it doesn&#39;t use the Proof-of-Work mechanism. To illustrate, Bitcoin&#39;s mining process is going through 3 steps: 1) Creating BTC coins 2) Coins Distributing 3) Verifying transactions across a decentralized system. Instead, Stellar&#39;s creation can be only with a mechanism called &quot;inflation&quot;, whereas Stellar relies on re-established nodes that validate transactions across a voting system. The rewards of the block are given to Stellar Nodes at a 1% inflation rate per year. XLM coins also could be distributed to as many people worldwide as possible in a series of the Stellar airdrop processes or giveaways (free Stellar coins) defined in their mandate via a direct voting method. You can acquire Stellar coins by trading on exchanges, being a recipient of inflation voting, and/or through the Foundation&#39;s XLM airdrop and giveaway programs.</p>
<h4 id="where-to-buy-xlm"><strong>Where to Buy XLM?</strong></h4>
<p>You can buy XLM through the crypto exchanges. Today, the majority of exchanges support trading XLM assets where you can get your XLM coins, but most of them allow you to buy/sell XLM only against BTC, USDT, and ETH. There are over 30 exchange platforms that provide XLM trading, the most popular ones are Binance, Bitfinex, HitBTC, Ethfinex, Coinegg, OKEx, Bit-Z, Huobi, etc.</p>

<li> <strong>Exchanges&#39; wallets</strong> like Binance, HTC, Exodus, Gate.io, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p>The future bears plenty of opportunities for Stellar, as well as some challenges. Among those challenges will be beating the competition in the arena it chooses from Ripple and other platforms such as OmiseGo. When it comes to its aspirations to be a crowdfunding platform, many more challenges may arise. The competition is not only against Ethereum but also now against new alternatives for crowdfunding such as the Binance Launchpad.

Its network has attracted the remittances world to move towards a space in which the position of sovereign currencies declined in favor of virtual currencies. Since launching, Stellar was able to surprise the crypto community by its rapidly-rising partnerships and its cutting-edge tech that is developing day by day. In our all-embracing review to Stellar Lumens (XLM), we&#39;ll cover all XLM cryptocurrency aspects and give you a close insight into the XLM real value. Let&#39;s head into it. </p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"what-is-stellar\\\"><strong>What is Stellar?</strong></h4>\\n<p>Stellar Lumens (XLM), a crypto project that is establishing a global financial network. Launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, a former co-founder of Ripple and David Mazieres, a professor of Computer Science. Stellar creators see a lack in the billion-dollar global remittance industry when it comes to the small cross border transactions with the high fees and slow service. To introduce an effective and cheap solution for cross border payments and other financing issues, Stellar is primarily designed to be a distributed payments network that is meant to afford a cheap, fast, and secure cross-border payment solution. The network also can be used as an ICO platform for issuing tokens, which is easier to use when compared with Ethereum. In the stellar network, users can pay in different currencies; fiat, gold, and XLM with other users, and registering debts of trusted users on the decentralized ledger. When the payments are completed, the user&#39;s balance will be registered upon the ledger. When users who do not trust each other try to send assets, the network finds a way to start from the beginning to end-user by a network of trusted user pairs. When the payment is finished, all balances along the trust path are stabilized instantly and straightaway. </p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"how-does-stellar-work\\\"><strong>How Does Stellar Work?</strong></h4>\\n<p>Stellar is utilizing a network of decentralized servers and a distributed ledger that is updating every 2-5 seconds among whole nodes. Unlike Bitcoin, Stellar&#39;s network with it’s unique and high-effective consensus protocol that is known as the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm is able to process transactions too fast. The FBA algorithm relies on quorum slices (or a part of the network) to validate a transaction, wherein every node in Stellar&#39;s network decides another set of trustworthy (nodes). When a transaction is approved by all nodes inside this set, this means the transaction is confirmed. That&#39;s what has made the Stellar network greatly fast and able to process 1,000 operations per second.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"what-is-xlm\\\"><strong>What is XLM?</strong></h4>\\n<p>XLM is the native and common currency of the Stellar network and has several use cases. The main use is for cheap and fast payments, you can start with creating your account with Stellar&#39;s network, and establish trust lines from your account to another account, in which payment fees (0.00001 XLM). Other uses of XLM such as a bridging currency for liquidity providing between users or entities who/which don&#39;t have a standard currency to complete exchanges. XLM coin also can be used for trading purposes like any other cryptocurrency asset. </p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"stellar-vs-ripple\\\"><strong>Stellar vs. Ripple</strong></h4>\\n<p>Both Stellar and Ripple are payment networks, were created by Jeb McCaleb, and are widely seen as competing networks. However, there are key differences between the two platforms. While some people falsely claim that Stellar is a fork of Ripple, but in fact, Stellar has its own unique code base, and the two have different philosophies. Ripple focuses on financial transactions in terms of the institutional side. It has sought partnerships with major global banks to replace global remittance networks. Stellar, on the other hand, is concerned more with individuals. It offers a platform that affirms inclusion and global financial literacy. After 5 years of development, Stellar has used a model known as Federated Byzantine Agreement to switch to the Stellar Consensus Protocol for its consensus mechanism, while Ripple remains with a protocol that uses a proof-of-correctness mechanism.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"stellar-lumens-partnerships\\\"><strong>Stellar Lumens Partnerships</strong></h4>\\n<p>Stellar mainly aims at helping unbanked people or who have low-income. Since its inception, the Stellar news has been revealing on new partnerships from time to time. Today, Stellar has plenty of strategic partnerships, the most important one with IBM, as the Stellar crypto news reported in 2017. The partnership aims to develop a cross-border blockchain-based payment system for large banks. Therefore, the efficiency of cross border transactions would be positively affected, especially for States of South-East Asia where many domestic helpers cannot afford to send money back home due to the remittance high cost. The program currently deals with 47 currencies and in 72 countries.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"pros-and-cons-of-stellar\\\"><strong>Pros and Cons of Stellar</strong></h4>\\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>  A decentralized network and open-source code.</li>\\n<li>  Transactions confirmation time: 2-5 seconds.</li>\\n<li>  Thousands of transactions per second.</li>\\n<li>  Fast, secure and inexpensive cross-border payments.</li>\\n<li>  Stellar has plenty of partnerships and support from non-profit institutes</li>\\n<li>  Enables Multi-signatures and Smart Contracts.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>  The Crypto industry already has some tough competitors to stellar in its chosen space, such as Ripple, Ethereum, and other new alternatives.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4 id=\\\"how-to-mine-xlm\\\"><strong>How to mine XLM?</strong></h4>\\n<p>Indeed, you can&#39;t mine XLM coins in a similar process to Bitcoin as it doesn&#39;t use the Proof-of-Work mechanism. To illustrate, Bitcoin&#39;s mining process is going through 3 steps: 1) Creating BTC coins 2) Coins Distributing 3) Verifying transactions across a decentralized system. Instead, Stellar&#39;s creation can be only with a mechanism called &quot;inflation&quot;, whereas Stellar relies on re-established nodes that validate transactions across a voting system. The rewards of the block are given to Stellar Nodes at a 1% inflation rate per year. XLM coins also could be distributed to as many people worldwide as possible in a series of the Stellar airdrop processes or giveaways (free Stellar coins) defined in their mandate via a direct voting method. You can acquire Stellar coins by trading on exchanges, being a recipient of inflation voting, and/or through the Foundation&#39;s XLM airdrop and giveaway programs.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"where-to-buy-xlm\\\"><strong>Where to Buy XLM?</strong></h4>\\n<p>You can buy XLM through the crypto exchanges. Today, the majority of exchanges support trading XLM assets where you can get your XLM coins, but most of them allow you to buy/sell XLM only against BTC, USDT, and ETH. There are over 30 exchange platforms that provide XLM trading, the most popular ones are Binance, Bitfinex, HitBTC, Ethfinex, Coinegg, OKEx, Bit-Z, Huobi, etc.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"buy-xml-with-changenow\\\"><strong>Buy XML with ChangeNOW</strong></h4>\\n<p>You can buy XLM instantly with the <a href=\\\"https://Changenow.io\\\">ChangeNOW</a> instant exchange tool that provides you a fast, secure, and simple way to buy XLM coins. Our service supports both cryptocurrencies and fiat with several purchase options swiftly and safely with minimal authentication procedures.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"4-steps-to-buy-xlm-coins\\\"><strong>4 Steps to buy XLM coins:</strong></h4>\\n<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From the <strong>ChangeNOW home page</strong>, choose a currency and enter the amount you would like to deposit. The service will automatically calculate the amount of BAT you will get. Then click on the Exchange button. With the current example, buying XLM for 1,000 USD via Credit Card. <img src=\\\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/image7_3_923_ddaa7ca363.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" > <strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter your XLM address (where you would like to receive your coins). <strong>Step 3.</strong> Double-check your information, then click <strong>Confirm</strong>. Remember that all operations are irreversible. <strong>Step 4.</strong> After you have confirmed the transaction, complete the purchasing process and you will receive your tokens immediately.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"how-to-store-xlm\\\"><strong>How to store XLM?</strong></h4>\\n<p>To store your XLM assets, choose a secure and reliable crypto wallet that supports the Stellar coin. You have a wide range of wallet options to store your XLM coins. But before you jump on a wallet, make sure it is compatible with XLM coins. You can pick one of our list for the best XLM wallets here:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>  <strong>Trust Wallet,</strong> a secure, user-friendly wallet that supports a great variety of cryptocurrencies, available for Web, Android, and iOS.</li>\\n<li>  <strong>LOBSTR, Curv, Ownbit and HTC Exodus</strong> are also proper wallets that support XLM cryptocurrency.</li>\\n<li>  <strong>Cold wallets</strong> (wallets that are not connected to the internet) such as <strong>Trezor</strong> or <strong>L****edger Nano S</strong>, which provide secure offline storage of your cryptocurrency assets.</li>\\n<li>  <strong>Exchanges&#39; wallets</strong> like Binance, HTC, Exodus, Gate.io, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4 id=\\\"conclusion\\\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\\n<p>The future bears plenty of opportunities for Stellar, as well as some challenges. Among those challenges will be beating the competition in the arena it chooses from Ripple and other platforms such as OmiseGo. When it comes to its aspirations to be a crowdfunding platform, many more challenges may arise. The competition is not only against Ethereum but also now against new alternatives for crowdfunding such as the Binance Launchpad. However, Stellar is a tough competitor itself, with an impressive feature set and multiple partnerships, among the most noteworthy of which is the partnership with IBM that could help boost the fortunes of Stellar. </p>\\n\"","categoryName":"market"}</script><script id="page-data">var pageData = {"blogNavigation":[{"id":1,"name":"News","url":"/news","icon":{"id":2466,"name":"Group 4226.svg","alternativeText":"news.svg","caption":"","hash":"Group_4226_7e84fe170a","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Group_4226_7e84fe170a.svg"}},{"id":2,"name":"Market","url":"/market","icon":{"id":2467,"name":"market.svg","alternativeText":"market.svg","caption":"","hash":"market_bac2e5f4ca","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/market_bac2e5f4ca.svg"}},{"id":3,"name":"Academy","url":"/academy","icon":{"id":2468,"name":"academy.svg","alternativeText":"academy.svg","caption":"","hash":"academy_4fd1287353","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/academy_4fd1287353.svg"}},{"id":4,"name":"Industry","url":"/industry","icon":{"id":2469,"name":"industry.svg","alternativeText":"industry.svg","caption":"","hash":"industry_314a1d18b2","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/industry_314a1d18b2.svg"}},{"id":5,"name":"Tech","url":"/tech","icon":{"id":2470,"name":"tech.svg","alternativeText":"tech.svg","caption":"","hash":"tech_742cce0c5f","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/tech_742cce0c5f.svg"}},{"id":6,"name":"Coins","url":"/coin","icon":{"id":2471,"name":"coins.svg","alternativeText":"coins.svg","caption":"","hash":"coins_66c249d0f3","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/coins_66c249d0f3.svg"}},{"id":8,"name":"ChangeNOW","url":"/changenow","icon":{"id":2559,"name":"cn menu.svg","alternativeText":"cn menu.svg","caption":"","hash":"cn_menu_907fd042ad","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/cn_menu_907fd042ad.svg"}},{"id":7,"name":"Coffee break","url":"/coffee-break","icon":{"id":2472,"name":"coffee.svg","alternativeText":"coffee.svg","caption":"","hash":"coffee_16b1d0fb0d","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/coffee_16b1d0fb0d.svg"}}],"blogTopStories":[{"id":1322,"title":"Why is crypto going up?","description":"Cryptocurrency is pumping presumably due to the UK crypto regulation news.

It will include 1,000 NFTs in the “Proof-of-Collection” style, which means those who own the collection would receive exclusive and privileged “types of experiences and possibilities, exploring the full potential of the physical and digital worlds.”\n<em>“The evolution of the cryptocurrency and NFT market has shown that NFTs that do not have a community proposal quickly lose their value as they are not based on real benefits but only on FUD and speculation. Furthermore, offering APYs with extreme profitability, as happened with UST/LUNA, turned out to be a failed proposition that only makes users lose their money,“</em> the rapper said.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/06_03_crypto_opinion_French_Montana_1_01_808638c28a.png\" alt=\"Exclusive: French Montana Unveils Plans to Revolutionize Music &amp; Crypto with Web3, NFTs, and Metaverse\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-new-era-of-nfts\">The New Era of NFTs</h2>\n<p><em>“The market experience has shown that projects based on memes and “Come Get Rich” promotions are nothing more than projects whose future is uncertain and often end up harming investors. By putting technology first, these projects have become highly reliant on royalties and hype to become a successful business. These events show us that success lies in focusing on projects that combine technology and real use cases,“</em> the artist explained.\nAccording to French Montana, the true value of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is not that they are an immutable digital representation of audiovisual items. <em>“It’s not just animated gifs and jpgs that are hashed on the blockchain, or items intended for speculation and FUD. The true value of NFTs lies in building a new digital identity and a new way of connecting communities through physical and digital experiences on a Web3.0 chain.“</em>\nMontana said that prior to the pandemic he had heard about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but never paid much attention to them. The pandemic, however, brought worldwide attention to the subject, which prompted him to read and seek to understand more about it.\nIt was then that he concluded it wasn’t just about digital currencies, but also about a new form of ‘contract’ that could give artists and the community back their data and ownership rights.\n<em>“When I started out, DVDs were the only game in town. Soon, YouTube became a huge deal. After that, the same happened with Instagram and TikTok. Now NFTs will be the next wave of technology to change the way music is produced and distributed and I want to be at the forefront of that with the French Family NFT,“</em> the rapper said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"french-family-membership--social-network\">French Family Membership + Social Network</h2>\n<p>French Montana said that he owns 100% of the production and distribution rights to his new album Montega, and Web3 is precisely about people being able to choose how their data is used. People want to own their preferences in Web3, such as their favorite songs, their artists, their avatars, etc.\n<em>“I want to own everything I produce and with NFTs I can share ownership of my production with my fans, with the French Family, who are the people who really make me grow as an artist, who come to my shows and who encourage and support me to continue doing my work”,</em> French said at the opening of the Miami NFT week.\nNow the artist revealed to Mike that French Family Membership will be your identity within the French Montana digital family. Therefore, as part of this family, each French Family Membership holder can get free access to all the events by French Montana or by some of French Montana’s friends in the USM Metaverse and the NFT marketplace.\nEach holder can release a virtual fashion brand cross-over with French Montana. The virtual brands are only for 3D avatars or for wearables on 3D avatars in the United States of Mars, USM. The design (Logo, images, words, pictures, videos) of virtual fashion brands’ should be voted by FM holders. More details will be announced by the French Family.\nIn addition, there will be more perks for French Family Membership holders linked to French Montana and some French Montana friends in USM, like the exclusive and unique collection DRWT PFP (under construction). More applications and projects are already being designed by the teams and will be announced exclusively for French Family Membership holders.\n<em>“This is our concept of building a community around French Family Membership. We are not talking about price speculation based on fomo, fud, attention, and influencers here. We are building a new decentralized digital community that expands individual possibilities while creating benefits for the entire community together,“</em> he said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"french-family-membership--copyright\">French Family Membership + Copyright</h2>\n<p>French revealed that each owner of the French Family Membership collection will also have rights attached to Montana’s new album “Montega”. The artist’s new production will be a connected music album with unique digital and physical experiences that will be unlocked through a collection of NFTs called “French Montana’s Music Album NFT” (MTG).\nFor this collection, three categories of MTG NFTs will be produced: Super Rare, Rare, and Normal, each with different benefits. And each member of the French Family will receive, via airdrop, super rare NFTs, which will unlock other exclusive benefits such as the digital version of the new Montega album, backstage access to French Montana concerts until 2025, and commercial and sales rights to the Montega album.\nTherefore, the holders of French Family Membership will also be lifetime copyright and commercial owners of the Montega album. It means that all the money that French Montana earns from the distribution and exhibition of the new album will be shared with the French Family Membership holders who will be entitled to receive a Super Rare NFT MTG.</p>\n<h2 id=\"french-family-membership--ethereum-layer-2-blockchain\">French Family Membership + Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchain</h2>\n<p><em>“We are creating a truly open and community-driven ecosystem for the French Family. This is not just an NFT project. We are talking about a real revolution in the cryptocurrency industry. The holders of a French Family NFT will truly be part of the French Montana family and, in doing so, will share with the star the benefits of everything we are creating, owning an NFT French Family Membership is not just a matter of commercial rights linked to the Montega album. There is so much more,“</em> revealed Jeff Watney, the visionary of French Family Membership NFT.\nFrench Family Membership also means being part of JAZ, the layer 2 blockchain linked to the collection, much like Solana or Polygon. This will eliminate problems similar to those that BAYC faced in the launch of Otherside, such as high gas fees.\nFurthermore, the new layer 2 blockchain will be born as the native network for the French Family Membership NFT and for all other projects that are already being built on the network. The blockchain will also have a development package that will allow the creation of dApps, play-to-earn games, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and NFT projects, among others. All this has been linked to exclusive and unique benefits for holders of the French Family Membership NFT collection.\nFrench Family NFT holders will benefit from nodes of the new network and, in addition to being validators of the new layer 2 solution, will receive rewards for transactions related to all JAZ-based projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"were-going-to-change-the-game\">‘We’re Going to Change the Game’</h2>\n<p>JAZ will be a decentralized and open blockchain solution for the entire community, comparable to what Solidity is to Ethereum. Developers will be able to create various blockchain-based applications through the JAZ development package. One of the projects that is already being built on JAZ involves a major Web3.0 project that will have an impact on the music industry and is already attracting attention from big names in the music ecosystem behind the scenes.\n<em>“Web3 gives musicians more control over their art and creation. Most artists only get 12% of what labels make. With 100% control over how my music is distributed, my community can grow. If I’m not mistaken the music industry makes $13m an hour with music and web 3 is definitely a revolution for artists to start gaining more capital,“</em> French Montana said.\nIn Montana’s opinion, the combination of NFTs, Web3 , and the metaverse could be an important tool to eliminate prejudice and allow people to live up to their full potential.\n<em>“Web3 is a powerful tool to build equality against the real world while there is no even. Early builders, creators and contributors will have more power and this more power is more possibilities for creating a better world. We are definitely going to change the game,“</em> he said.</p>\n<p><em>Mike Ermolaev, the Head of Public Relations at <a href=\"https://changenow.io/\">ChangeNOW.io</a>, conducts exclusive interviews with prominent crypto experts for Benzinga to provide beginners and seasoned crypto investors alike with valuable insight into the world of crypto.

Its main features include professional charting tools for financial markets and a graphical interface that makes it possible to track and predict market trends. Lastly, it’s used for the analysis of profitable investment opportunities. </p>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market has found its own user base on <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/\">TradingView</a>. With a little bit of training, you can learn how to analyze crypto charts to make better financial decisions concerning your investments. The cryptocurrency markets aren’t that different from traditional financial markets, but they have their own characteristics and peculiarities.     </p>\n<p>Let’s now see how to analyze a TradingView chart and understand what it shows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-what-candlesticks-and-candlestick-charts-are\">Understanding What Candlesticks and Candlestick Charts Are</h2>\n<p><strong>Candlesticks</strong> show the price of a particular asset in a specific period. So by looking at a candle, we can see a few different things. </p>\n<p>Take a look at this <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/cDwWYDni/\">Bitcoin/USDT chart from TradingView</a> to understand what information a single candlestick entails.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_24a24a038d.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>A candle is made up of a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>wick</strong>. The body is the wide part of the image, and the narrow lines you see above and under it are called wicks. The size of the body depends on the price movement in that time period. For example, suppose these candles are for the 1-hour chart. In that case, the body shows how much the price fluctuated during that hour.</p>\n<p>Candlesticks can be <strong>green</strong> or <strong>red</strong>. A green candle on a 1-hour chart shows that the price closed above the value it opened at after one hour. Opposite to that, a red candle shows that the closing value has depreciated compared to the valuation at the start of that period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-how-do-we-know-where-the-price-opened-and-where-it-closed\">But how do we know where the price opened and where it closed?</h3>\n<p>Look at the body of the green candle above. The bottom line of its body was the asset&#39;s price when that time period started. The top of the body represents the value when the timeframe ended. The wicks show the highest and lowest value the price moved to during that period. The wick on top is obviously the high, while the one at the bottom is the low.</p>\n<p>A red candle is an exact opposite. The top of this candle’s body is the opening price, while the bottom is the closing one. The wick lines are the same as with the bullish green candlestick.</p>\n<p>When we group these candles together, we get a <strong>candlestick chart</strong> that looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed2_aabbd8489a.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed2.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"recognizing-trends-and-market-movements-based-on-candlesticks\">Recognizing Trends and Market Movements Based on Candlesticks</h2>\n<p>Now that we know what candlesticks are, we can look at TradingView charts and try to predict <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynxyoKgpng\">trending markets</a></strong>. Knowing whether we are in an <strong>upward</strong> or <strong>downward</strong> trend makes it easier to predict what happens next and when and where to place our buy and sell orders. Making trading decisions based on a current trend is a popular strategy because it’s easier than predicting when a bear or bull market is likely to start.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uptrend-markets\">Uptrend Markets</h3>\n<p>When the market is in an uptrend, you will notice that the candles create the following movements: new highs, followed by higher lows, new higher highs, new higher lows, etc., in regular intervals. </p>\n<p>Here is an excellent example of how that looks on a candlestick chart:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_8ca27c835e.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>But not all graphs are that simple, and sometimes it is difficult to recognize the patterns of a trending market. Therefore, there are some other indicators you should pay attention to.</p>\n<p>One interesting thing we can watch out for in trending markets are so-called <strong>impulsive moves</strong>. Whenever a price change leads to reaching a new high, we call that an <strong>impulsive move</strong>. After such an event, we often see a <strong>pullback</strong>. A pullback in an uptrend is when the value drops down from its peak for a brief period.</p>\n<p>To check whether the market is still trending upwards, we need to look at the charts and check the lowest closing price of the previous pullback. The value can’t close below that price for the market to still be considered an uptrend. When we see an impulsive move followed by a new high, the subsequent price action will be a pullback. The latest lowest point of that pullback must be above the line of the previous one. If it isn’t and closes below it, we may be witnessing a <strong>reversal</strong> and an end of the uptrend movement. </p>\n<p>This is how it looks on our previous graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_19215e9c9e.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h3 id=\"downtrend-markets\">Downtrend Markets</h3>\n<p>Using the opposite rules that we applied to upward movements, a downward market is recognized by lower lows and lower highs than what we witnessed previously. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_62fab9b0f8.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>We will use the same logic with impulsive moves and pullbacks to determine whether we are still in a downward trending market. However, a pullback will cause a slight rise in the asset’s value in this scenario.</p>\n<p>When we have an impulsive move followed by a pullback, the market can’t close above the highest point of the previous pullback. As long as it stays below, we are still in a downtrend market. </p>\n<p>Here we can see that represented on the graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_cb80af26fd.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"support--resistance-what-is-it-and-how-to-take-advantage-of-it\">Support & Resistance: What Is It and How to Take Advantage of It?</h2>\n<p>Support and resistance are zones where a traded asset finds a type of barrier that prevents it from further growth or decline. For example, if Bitcoin’s value drops, <strong>support</strong> will act as a safe zone to stop further price depreciation. Why? Because traders have submitted enough buy orders at that level to purchase the asset at a discount. Opposite of that, we have <strong>resistance</strong>. This tool acts as another barrier that stops the further rise of a listed asset. </p>\n<p>Support and resistance can be used to identify 3 things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possible reversals</li>\n<li>Entry points into a trending market</li>\n<li>Stop-loss and target zones in trending markets</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"identify-entry-points-based-on-support-and-resistance\">Identify Entry Points Based on Support and Resistance</h3>\n<p>If we suppose that an upward trending market will continue, we can find a previous high point (which acted as resistance) that was later broken during an impulsive move. That high now becomes support after a market pullback. If the price drops to that area and rebounds back up, the zone can be considered support. </p>\n<p>Let’s look at a simple chart showing this concept on an upward market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_2b0ecb21ae.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>We apply the opposite approach in a downtrend market if we expect the bearish trend to continue. We are looking for a low point that acted as support just before a pullback to find these zones. After the price rebounded back up from the support zone, the downtrend continued, the previous low point was broken, and a new low was set. We then witness a second pullback after an impulsive move. The price shoots back up to the zone that acted as a support. However, this area has now become resistance causing the market to reverse and continue the downtrend.  </p>\n<p>This is how it looks like on a TradingView graph:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_7fb0dd5c6f.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<p>Identifying these areas of interest makes it easier to set buy or sell orders in a trending market. That&#39;s because we now have a good idea of how the price action will continue.</p>\n<p>Suppose you have successfully recognized support and resistance in an upward market. In that case, you know the area beyond which the price will not fall. You can set your buy order in this support zone with a stop-loss slightly under it just in case the price drops further before it rebounds. By now, you have learned that in a bullish (uptrend) market, the lowest point of the pullback can’t close below the low point of the previous pullback. If that is still the case, the current trend will likely continue, and a new high will be broken. If you are a trader, your target zone where you take profits could be in the area of the previous high.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/unnamed_9a7f67525f.jpeg\" alt=\"unnamed.jpeg\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>TradingView is the most popular charting tool in the world. Candlesticks are the main components of any professional graph. Based on the candle movements and patterns, it’s possible to determine what direction a market is taking. The two most common scenarios are upward and downward trends.</p>\n<p>By identifying zones in a trending market that act as support and resistance, we will understand what to expect next and apply our trading strategy. If the goal is to trade profitably, we can use this knowledge to set a realistic target zone where we intend to sell and a stop-loss limit to protect us from significant upsets.    </p>\n","blogCategories":[{"id":5,"name":"Market","description":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","slug":"market","locale":"en","blogPost":null,"hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Market - Crypto Blog & News","metaDescription":"All there is to know about the crypto market: helpful guides, explanatory articles, and expert opinions on the current market state.","image":{"id":null,"name":null,"alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"hash":null,"ext":null,"url":null,"formatLarge":null,"formatMedium":null,"formatSmall":"https://changenow.io/images/blog-post-preview.jpg","formatThumbnail":null}}],"localizations":[],"blogAuthor":{"id":3,"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kane","description":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","slug":"jeremykane","fullUrl":"https://changenow.io/blog/author/jeremykane","linkedIn":null,"twitter":null,"occupation":"Crypto writer","locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"metaTitle":"Jeremy Kane","metaDescription":"HODL, miss diamond hands!","image":{"id":2610,"name":"Marconi_3 (1).jpg","alternativeText":"Crypto Writer | Crypto Writer Jobs","caption":"","hash":"Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd","ext":".jpg","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Marconi_3_1_408fdab4bd.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2021-09-29T16:32:19.717Z","createdAt":"2021-09-24T14:15:15.515Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-22T13:33:50.592Z","localizations":[]},"blogCategoryNames":["market"],"publishedAt":"2022-04-15T09:40:41.777Z","createdAt":"2022-04-15T09:40:40.751Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-20T11:58:48.803Z"},{"id":1122,"title":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet","description":"Users can now export private keys with the new version of NOW Wallet.","slug":"private-keys-export-feature-added-to-now-wallet","metaTitle":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet ","metaDescription":"Users can now export private keys with the new version of NOW Wallet.","featuredImage":{"id":4573,"name":"Private keys export-02.png","alternativeText":"Private Keys Export Feature Added to NOW Wallet ","caption":"","hash":"Private_keys_export_01_123981538f","ext":".png","url":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatLarge":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/large_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatMedium":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/medium_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatSmall":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/small_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png","formatThumbnail":"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/thumbnail_Private_keys_export_01_123981538f.png"},"locale":"en","hasNoIndex":false,"content":"<p>Signing transactions and proving ownership of blockchain addresses require private keys.

Read our article to find out what staking is all about, so you can take advantage of this concept to earn rewards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-crypto-staking-mean\">What Does Crypto Staking Mean??</h2>\n<p>A short definition of staking states it is the process of holding coins for your mining pool. </p>\n<p>Staking is a process where users hold funds in their accounts to support a blockchain network. When you hold coins, you can receive rewards from your blockchain. Staking, therefore, allows users to earn rewards with their crypto holdings. It has become a popular way for investors to earn a passive income, due to the higher interest rates that it generates. The income earned through the rates being generated is sometimes even higher than you would earn with a savings account – making it a great alternative to traditional investments.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content-api.changenow.io/uploads/02_17_Staking_101_1_01_a1320160c8.png\" alt=\"Staking Explained: All You Need to Know\" ></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-crypto-staking-work\">How Does Crypto Staking Work?</h2>\n<p>Staking uses a proof-of-stake model, meaning that crypto users can lock in (or pledge) their coins for some time. The proof-of-stake consensus algorithm allows for a large number of transactions to be processed at a time and uses less cost per transaction than regular models. </p>\n<p>The staking period can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the type of cryptocurrency you are staking. Users cannot withdraw their coins or do any transactions during this period. If you do transact, you will lose out on your interest similar to traditional investments. </p>\n<p>Staking works through various cryptocurrency exchanges. You get to choose the amount you want to stake, although some cryptocurrencies may require you to stake a particular amount. However, you can pull out your stake if you change your mind (unstake your coins). You don’t “lose” your coins when you choose to unstake – they remain in your wallet and you can trade them as usual, later on.</p>\n<p>You can become a validator by pledging coins. A validator is someone who is chosen to verify transactions on a blockchain network. Although this is randomly chosen, the more coins you invest, the better chance you have of being chosen as a validator. </p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-staking-crypto\">Benefits of Staking Crypto</h2>\n<p>Staking serves as a great alternative to banking investments, with far less risk. </p>\n<p>The process uses a proof-to-take algorithm, using less energy than regular mining which uses a proof-of-work model.</p>\n<p>It’s an easy way to earn interest on your coins, with no equipment or tools needed. When you stake and become a validator, you help to ensure the security of the entire blockchain by </p>\n<p>supporting it as a whole. You can earn more than 20% interest in a year, depending on the crypto you are staking. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-stake-crypto\">How to Stake Crypto</h2>\n<p>Are you ready to stake? The process of staking can be overwhelming at first, but with time and practice, you can earn rewards easily. If you need help getting started, don’t panic, here’s an easy step-by-step guide to help you get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choose-a-cryptocurrency-to-stake\">Choose a cryptocurrency to stake</h3>\n<p>Look for a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and buy your <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies\">coins</a>. You can only stake with crypto that supports this model. It’s also possible to use a crypto trading platform to buy these coins. Before you choose a coin, it is recommended that you do your research to see which coin fits your budget and needs. Crypto can be unpredictable, but it’s a great long-term investment. Even if you choose not to use your coins for staking, they can be used to buy and sell assets. This means you need to choose a currency that is going to be worth your time and money.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t know which coin to invest in? Here’s a list to help you decide which crypto to choose:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ethereum has the highest crypto value after Bitcoin, making it a great investment. It’s affordable and is considered one of the most fluid liquid assets in crypto. Staking and Ethereum usually go hand-in-hand due to their popularity and lower inflation rates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/cardano\">Cardano</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cardano is more energy-efficient than most crypto. It’s also low-priced and a favorite with investors due to it being more programmable than Bitcoin. Staking investors use Cardano for its lower costs, making it popular and environmentally friendly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/polkadot\">Polkadot</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Polkadot works on multiple blockchains. It allows data and tokens to be transferred along with blockchains, making it a fast-growing crypto among investors. Polkadot is expected to do well as many high-end investors are now starting to invest in the coin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/solana\">Solana</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to its low fees, Solana is considered good crypto to invest in. It is the closest to Ethereum when it comes to speed and affordability. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/terra\">Terra</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Terra is a stablecoin that is cheap and allows for quick and easy transactions. Terra’s suite of stablecoins include US pegged TerraUSD (UST) and other coins pegged to the Euro, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/tezos\">Tezos</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tezos is an environmental blockchain. It uses the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and is considered to be one of the most secure cryptos. Tezos has gained popularity due to the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFT) in gaming networks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choose-a-blockchain-wallet\">Choose a blockchain wallet</h3>\n<p>Once you buy your coins, you need to transfer them to a crypto or blockchain wallet. Depending on the platform you use, you can probably stake directly through the exchanges. In most cases, you will have to move your funds to a wallet. Crypto wallets help you to safely store your coins. Wallets are available to download, or you can use them on <a href=\"https://www.cryptowisser.com/8-best-crypto-affiliate-programs-in-2022\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">crypto affiliate programs</a> or platforms. </p>\n<p>Staking is simple using ChangeNOW’s NOW Wallet app. The NOW Wallet does not collect any data and you can store funds on your device safely and securely. NOW Wallet keeps adding new cryptocurrencies and NFTs to the range so you can stake using crypto of your choice. It&#39;s worth mentioning that the app supports staking of BEP2 NOW tokens. You can <a href=\"https://walletnow.app/\">download NOW Wallet</a>to your device for easy transactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deposit-your-coins\">Deposit your coins</h3>\n<p>Once you have your wallet, it’s time to deposit. You can choose which crypto you prefer and deposit your coins. You will then be provided with a wallet address.</p>\n<h3 id=\"find-a-crypto-staking-pool\">Find a crypto staking pool</h3>\n<p>After your funds are deposited, you can join a staking pool. A staking pool is a mining wallet where crypto traders combine their resources to earn better staking rewards. You need to do your research to decide which staking pool is best for you, and the crypto you want to stake. </p>\n<p><strong>Here are some tips when choosing a staking pool:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s best to choose a staking pool that has reasonable fees.</li>\n<li>Make sure there are no hidden fees.</li>\n<li>The staking pool should not crash and not be slow.</li>\n<li>Choose a pool that&#39;s not too small, as fewer investors can be risky.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start staking!</p>\n<p>Once you have found your pool, you are ready to stake it. Staking crypto can be done through your wallet. Simply choose the amount you want to stake to get started. You are now ready to earn rewards!</p>\n<h2 id=\"staking-tips\">Staking Tips</h2>\n<p><strong>Don’t be afraid to stake more if you have the funds available.</strong> If you aren’t going to use your crypto in the future, it is the best way to earn funds as it requires virtually no effort. </p>\n<p><strong>Do your research before you begin.</strong> Start by researching the different types of cryptos, as well as useful tips such as the ones provided in this article to help you make decisions. </p>\n<p><strong>Be patient.</strong> Staking is a long-term investment and as such, it requires time and patience on your part. Try not to pull out your stake unless you need the coins. The longer you stake, the better chance you have of earning a high reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Be careful of crypto projects with extremely high-interest rates.</strong> Sometimes this may be too good to be true, or it can be used as a tactic to get more investors on board. Staking rates can also quickly drop on these projects, which is why doing your research beforehand is essential.</p>\n<p><strong>Choose the exchange you are going to use for staking carefully.</strong> Most exchanges are going to make a commission off your stake, so choose the commission that works for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"should-you-choose-to-stake\">Should You Choose to Stake?</h2>\n<p>Staking is a trend that is here to stay. Today, staking is offered through many exchanges and cryptocurrencies. As rewards become available, more people are choosing to stake to earn a passive income. Investors around the world, as well as financial and retail institutions, will likely join in on the staking trend and find ways to work with crypto holders. </p>\n<p>Choosing to stake puts you ahead of the pack. You can earn rewards without doing much, and you can earn more interest per year than traditional investors. Although market rates may vary, it is essential to choose the crypto that works for you. Do your research before you stake to guarantee that you make a profit. As with all investments, staking takes time. If you have patience, the funds, and the discipline to earn rewards through long-term crypto investments, staking is a good investment.

One way or another, it’s a profitable sector and a prosperous industry.</p>\n<p>Even with ups and downs — that the whole cryptocurrency industry invariably goes through — savvy traders usually come out with a profit. One of the main challenges, even for experienced traders, is understanding how to calculate cryptocurrency profits.</p>\n<p>Because cryptocurrencies always go up and down, it’s crucial to diversify a portfolio. It usually makes sense to hold some of the largest and most popular cryptocurrencies, such as <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> (BTC), <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> (ETH), <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin-cash\">Bitcoin Cash</a>, <a href=\"https://changenow.io/currencies/ripple\">Ripple</a>, and several others. Alongside these, it is good to diversify as much as possible — aiming to benefit from new opportunities whenever they come along — such as ICO’s and IDO’s and therefore new coins and cryptocurrencies. </p>\n<p>Whether you are buying or selling, trading, swapping, exchanging or mining, it’s crucial to know how to calculate profits. In this article, we look at the easiest ways to do that, so that you can have a clear idea about how much profit you have made from every transaction. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-calculate-crypto-trading-profits\">How to calculate crypto trading profits</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, for those buying and selling cryptocurrencies, the basic principles of calculating profits are quite simple. There’s a price you buy the crypto for and the price you sell it at. </p>\n<p>Say you bought two Bitcoins (BTC) for $25,000 and you sell them for $35,000, then the Gross Profit is $10,000. With every crypto profit calculation, the first thing you need to do is know the number of coins you are buying and the price. Then when it comes to selling, you should note the number you are selling and the price at the time of that transaction. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ycWgz8aYgrJtKWrS5I0OKDomjvjK3r2vxHUiBoq5Rpq452rPYo09ozwc6JEnupnD-1xniI63hiIOsG2OiQfKmZnXqCLBApv4bJ4QyjdI3YXH4Q782wWTagbJ_Zxj3ijN7DNg1cQr\" alt=\"\" width=\"508\" height=\"304\"></p>\n<p>As you can choose to hold however much crypto, to keep in a portfolio or for a rainy day, you may not be selling as many as you bought. However, for the purposes of calculating profits, let’s assume you sell both BTC for $35,000, as per the example above. </p>\n<p>The profit you make isn&#39;t the full $10,000.</p>\n<p>There are always fees and other costs to consider, depending on the way you sell them, such as on an exchange. Every exchange — whether centralized or decentralized — charges different fees. </p>\n<p>Exchange fees can include any of the following, as described in <a href=\"https://changenow.io/faq\">ChangeNOW FAQs</a>: </p>\n<p>- Network fee for the deposit transaction from a customer&#39;s wallet;</p>\n<p>- Network fee for transferring coins to our liquidity provider;</p>\n<p>- Trading fees that our liquidity providers charge;</p>\n<p>- Network fee for sending the exchanged funds to the customer.</p>\n<p>Traders can buy, sell, and exchange crypto on ChangeNOW, and our policy and approach to these fees is to ensure we find the fastest and most user-profitable way to execute an exchange. It is crucial to us that the final amount you receive is as close to the estimate as possible. That&#39;s why we calculate all the possible fees for every transaction very thoroughly and include them in the estimate. </p>\n<p>Which means, with ChangeNOW, you are never going to be stung with high fees when buying and selling crypto. Regardless of the exchange and therefore the way you buy and sell crypto, there are always fees to consider. Other fees you are likely to encounter when trading cryptocurrency include gas fees, exit fees, and investment fees. </p>\n<p>So let’s say the average total of those accumulated and largely unavoidable fees are 3%, then you need to take that off the Gross Profit. Therefore, let’s apply that to the above example: </p>\n<p>Buy 2 x BTC = $25,000.00</p>\n<p>Sell 2 x BTC = $35,000.00</p>\n<p>Gross Profit = $10,000.00</p>\n<p>Fees: - 3% (of the total sale price) = $1,050.00</p>\n<p>Net Profit (Gross - Fees) = $8,950.00</p>\n<p>What if you are someone who trades a lot every day? Some traders are juggling dozens or hundreds or more transactions every day. Constantly buying and selling to benefit and profit from any number of micro price fluctuations. </p>\n<p>It would make sense to get a calculator specifically designed around the needs of crypto traders. A calculator, which pulls data in real-time from CoinMarketCap, to ensure you know how much has been gained or lost when transactions are happening, thereby keeping profit margins clear. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JT_HJ_MQ0rwgRUKxDhti2NNX-XKdfOSqZcHF4Wsubx7Y5dxKVE3AsIE2-hzUCyP_gyH8wBgxP3fBo5aEIW_B88r-T9LmGOldYOkEW1yTwFlr2hKfszoxN4NRgKqaxjAPfXmrwgRQ\" alt=\"\" width=\"427\" height=\"315\"></p>\n<p><em>South Korea is one of many countries seeking to tax crypto profits more effectively, according to</em> <a href=\"https://azcoinnews.com/south-korea-will-implement-a-20-tax-on-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-profits-starting-january-1-2022.html\"><em>AZCoin News</em></a><em>.</em> </p>\n<p>Here is another example of a handy, easy-to-use <a href=\"https://btc.feh.im/\">crypto profit calculator</a>. Having one of these open at all times makes it simple when it comes to working out the profits as you are trading. </p>\n<h2 id=\"calculating-exchanging-crypto-to-fiat-profits\">Calculating exchanging crypto-to-fiat profits</h2>\n<p>Because cryptocurrency is, at the end of the day, another form of currency, calculating the rate of exchange between any fiat currency and any crypto is fairly simple. In the same way that calculating the exchange rate between USD$ and Euros (EU€) can be done quickly and easily using Google Calculator and numerous other platforms and apps. </p>\n<p>Other ways to do this include the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/converter/\">CoinMarketCap calculator</a> and <a href=\"https://www.currexy.com/cryptocurrency/converter\">Currexy</a>, as a way of working out exchange rates between crypto and fiat currencies. Yet again, fees always need to be factored into the overall profits you come out with. </p>\n<p>When transferring from <a href=\"https://changenow.io/buy\">fiat to crypto</a>, or the other way round, there are always profits to be made. Providing you buy and sell at the right time. Knowing when to hold and when to sell is the key to making healthy profits. Once you&#39;ve calculated the relevant fees, depending on the exchange — whether centralized or decentralized — then you will have a Net Profit figure. </p>\n<h2 id=\"calculating-mining-profits\">Calculating mining profits</h2>\n<p>Mining cryptocurrencies or pre-ICO or IDO tokens is somewhat different than simply buying and selling already established cryptocurrencies. You can of course do that too, and millions of people do. Mining Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto’s is a route to generating profits, but it isn&#39;t as easy and requires more investment than simply buying and selling cryptocurrency. </p>\n<p>There are two ways to approach this. You can either mine an already established cryptocurrency, or you can stake (which means make a small investment) and offer to mine a pre-ICO or IDO token, which means one that hasn&#39;t launched. This does make it potentially more risky, especially before lock-in periods end, the tokens are available and compatible with exchanges, and you can start selling/exchanging these coins for other cryptocurrencies.  </p>\n<p>When mining any cryptocurrency or coin, there are a number of initial and ongoing costs to think about first. Long before any profits are generated. </p>\n<p>Firstly, you need a powerful computer or rig. The more powerful the better, and therefore, more expensive. You need one with as much hashing power as possible. </p>\n<p>Ongoing costs include the power consumption in watts, running costs for every kWh, total electricity costs, and then pool fees. Plus, if you are mining a pre-ICO or IDO token, then you usually have a staked and locked-in minimum investment required (either in fiat or another cryptocurrency). </p>\n<p>Once you’ve deducted all of those costs, then you will have a profit. One of the best ways to work this out is to use the <a href=\"https://btc.com/tools/mining-calculator\">BTC.com</a> Mining Calculator, or <a href=\"https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=70&amp;HashingUnit=TH%2Fs&amp;PowerConsumption=1500&amp;CostPerkWh=0.12&amp;MiningPoolFee=1\">CryptoCompare Calculator</a>.

Although crypto largely operates outside of the traditional financial services sector, most governments and tax collection agencies recognize it as a form of taxable income. </p>\n<p>Consequently, you need to work out how much tax is likely to be payable on profits so you can start setting it aside. You can get an understanding on this based on a number of factors. Ultimately, it always pays to speak with an accountant. Like with any business or income generating activity, profits are also offset by any losses, and of course costs encountered in the process of earning the top-line figure. </p>\n<p>How much you are taxed also depends on where you reside most of the time (and tax rates in that country), where any legal entities are registered, and a wide number of other factors.

In our all-embracing review to Stellar Lumens (XLM), we&#39;ll cover all XLM cryptocurrency aspects and give you a close insight into the XLM real value. Let&#39;s head into it. </p>\n<h4 id=\"what-is-stellar\"><strong>What is Stellar?</strong></h4>\n<p>Stellar Lumens (XLM), a crypto project that is establishing a global financial network. Launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, a former co-founder of Ripple and David Mazieres, a professor of Computer Science. Stellar creators see a lack in the billion-dollar global remittance industry when it comes to the small cross border transactions with the high fees and slow service. To introduce an effective and cheap solution for cross border payments and other financing issues, Stellar is primarily designed to be a distributed payments network that is meant to afford a cheap, fast, and secure cross-border payment solution. The network also can be used as an ICO platform for issuing tokens, which is easier to use when compared with Ethereum. In the stellar network, users can pay in different currencies; fiat, gold, and XLM with other users, and registering debts of trusted users on the decentralized ledger. When the payments are completed, the user&#39;s balance will be registered upon the ledger. When users who do not trust each other try to send assets, the network finds a way to start from the beginning to end-user by a network of trusted user pairs. When the payment is finished, all balances along the trust path are stabilized instantly and straightaway. </p>\n<h4 id=\"how-does-stellar-work\"><strong>How Does Stellar Work?</strong></h4>\n<p>Stellar is utilizing a network of decentralized servers and a distributed ledger that is updating every 2-5 seconds among whole nodes. Unlike Bitcoin, Stellar&#39;s network with it’s unique and high-effective consensus protocol that is known as the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm is able to process transactions too fast. The FBA algorithm relies on quorum slices (or a part of the network) to validate a transaction, wherein every node in Stellar&#39;s network decides another set of trustworthy (nodes). When a transaction is approved by all nodes inside this set, this means the transaction is confirmed. That&#39;s what has made the Stellar network greatly fast and able to process 1,000 operations per second.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-is-xlm\"><strong>What is XLM?</strong></h4>\n<p>XLM is the native and common currency of the Stellar network and has several use cases. The main use is for cheap and fast payments, you can start with creating your account with Stellar&#39;s network, and establish trust lines from your account to another account, in which payment fees (0.00001 XLM). Other uses of XLM such as a bridging currency for liquidity providing between users or entities who/which don&#39;t have a standard currency to complete exchanges. XLM coin also can be used for trading purposes like any other cryptocurrency asset. </p>\n<h4 id=\"stellar-vs-ripple\"><strong>Stellar vs. Ripple</strong></h4>\n<p>Both Stellar and Ripple are payment networks, were created by Jeb McCaleb, and are widely seen as competing networks. However, there are key differences between the two platforms. While some people falsely claim that Stellar is a fork of Ripple, but in fact, Stellar has its own unique code base, and the two have different philosophies. Ripple focuses on financial transactions in terms of the institutional side. It has sought partnerships with major global banks to replace global remittance networks. Stellar, on the other hand, is concerned more with individuals. It offers a platform that affirms inclusion and global financial literacy. After 5 years of development, Stellar has used a model known as Federated Byzantine Agreement to switch to the Stellar Consensus Protocol for its consensus mechanism, while Ripple remains with a protocol that uses a proof-of-correctness mechanism.</p>\n<h4 id=\"stellar-lumens-partnerships\"><strong>Stellar Lumens Partnerships</strong></h4>\n<p>Stellar mainly aims at helping unbanked people or who have low-income. Since its inception, the Stellar news has been revealing on new partnerships from time to time. Today, Stellar has plenty of strategic partnerships, the most important one with IBM, as the Stellar crypto news reported in 2017. The partnership aims to develop a cross-border blockchain-based payment system for large banks. Therefore, the efficiency of cross border transactions would be positively affected, especially for States of South-East Asia where many domestic helpers cannot afford to send money back home due to the remittance high cost. The program currently deals with 47 currencies and in 72 countries.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pros-and-cons-of-stellar\"><strong>Pros and Cons of Stellar</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>  A decentralized network and open-source code.</li>\n<li>  Transactions confirmation time: 2-5 seconds.</li>\n<li>  Thousands of transactions per second.</li>\n<li>  Fast, secure and inexpensive cross-border payments.</li>\n<li>  Stellar has plenty of partnerships and support from non-profit institutes</li>\n<li>  Enables Multi-signatures and Smart Contracts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>  The Crypto industry already has some tough competitors to stellar in its chosen space, such as Ripple, Ethereum, and other new alternatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"how-to-mine-xlm\"><strong>How to mine XLM?</strong></h4>\n<p>Indeed, you can&#39;t mine XLM coins in a similar process to Bitcoin as it doesn&#39;t use the Proof-of-Work mechanism. To illustrate, Bitcoin&#39;s mining process is going through 3 steps: 1) Creating BTC coins 2) Coins Distributing 3) Verifying transactions across a decentralized system. Instead, Stellar&#39;s creation can be only with a mechanism called &quot;inflation&quot;, whereas Stellar relies on re-established nodes that validate transactions across a voting system. The rewards of the block are given to Stellar Nodes at a 1% inflation rate per year. XLM coins also could be distributed to as many people worldwide as possible in a series of the Stellar airdrop processes or giveaways (free Stellar coins) defined in their mandate via a direct voting method. You can acquire Stellar coins by trading on exchanges, being a recipient of inflation voting, and/or through the Foundation&#39;s XLM airdrop and giveaway programs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"where-to-buy-xlm\"><strong>Where to Buy XLM?</strong></h4>\n<p>You can buy XLM through the crypto exchanges. Today, the majority of exchanges support trading XLM assets where you can get your XLM coins, but most of them allow you to buy/sell XLM only against BTC, USDT, and ETH. There are over 30 exchange platforms that provide XLM trading, the most popular ones are Binance, Bitfinex, HitBTC, Ethfinex, Coinegg, OKEx, Bit-Z, Huobi, etc.</p>\n<h4 id=\"buy-xml-with-changenow\"><strong>Buy XML with ChangeNOW</strong></h4>\n<p>You can buy XLM instantly with the <a href=\"https://Changenow.io\">ChangeNOW</a> instant exchange tool that provides you a fast, secure, and simple way to buy XLM coins. Our service supports both cryptocurrencies and fiat with several purchase options swiftly and safely with minimal authentication procedures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4-steps-to-buy-xlm-coins\"><strong>4 Steps to buy XLM coins:</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From the <strong>ChangeNOW home page</strong>, choose a currency and enter the amount you would like to deposit. The service will automatically calculate the amount of BAT you will get. Then click on the Exchange button.
