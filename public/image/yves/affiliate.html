This allows our clients to avoid identification or financial theft. We offer the best rates on the market, as we use reliable cryptocurrency trading platforms.","Q5_TITLE":"How fast will my transaction be processed?","Q5_TEXT":"The processing speed ranges from about two to twenty minutes, depending on how long it takes for a block to happen in the network. Most orders process in just a few minutes. If the transaction is large (more than 1 BTC or equivalent), processing it may take a little longer, depending on the size of your transaction and the capacity of the block. We boast the highest exchange speeds on the market thanks to our revolutionary trading algorithms.","Q6_TITLE":"Where do I store my crypto funds?","Q6_TEXT":"If you want to own cryptocurrency, you need to store it somewhere. Different cryptocurrency wallets are tailored specifically for different operations with transactions. There are official wallets, web purses, and other applications. For each crypto coin, you need to have a separate wallet.","Q7_TITLE":"What is cryptocurrency wallet address?","Q7_TEXT":"Cryptocurrency wallet address is a unique combination of numbers and letters ranging from 26 to 35 characters in length. It usually looks something like this: 17bkZPLB4Wn6F347PLZBR34ijhzQDUFZ4ZC.","Q8_TITLE":"How do I get my cryptocurrency wallet address?","Q8_TEXT_1":"When you decide which crypto coin you would like to acquire, find a reliable wallet. Each cryptocurrency has an official one. When you create a wallet, you automatically get an address and a private key. Keep your private key to yourself and don’t show it to anyone, even if they ask.","Q8_TEXT_2":"For security reasons, we will never ask you for your private keys and nobody should.","Q9_TITLE":"What is a recipient wallet address?","Q9_TEXT":"If you want to buy a cryptocurrency, you need to have it sent to a specific crypto wallet. Each coin has its own one. The recipient address is your wallet, to which your crypto is transferred after the exchange.","Q10_TITLE":"What is a transaction hash?","Q10_TEXT":"Transaction hash (also referred to as \"TX\") is the unique identification code that registers every transaction in the blockchain. This unique code allows you to verify its status and validity in the blockchain.","Q11_TITLE":"How can I cancel a transaction?","Q11_TEXT":"Blockchain operations are irreversible. If the funds are sent, the transaction cannot be canceled by anyone. Therefore, thoroughly check all the payment details before sending funds to anyone, including us or anyone else.","Q12_TITLE":"Why is the final amount of funds different from the initial amount?","Q12_TEXT":"It takes some time to process transactions. Due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency, speed is crucial, however, the final exchange rate can differ both in the positive or negative direction. What we guarantee is the best rate at the very moment of an exchange operation.","Q13_TITLE":"How long does it take for a transaction to be finished?","Q13_TEXT_1":"Transactions on ChangeNOW usually take from 5 to 30 minutes. If your transaction takes more time, it may be due to various issues:","Q13_TEXT_2":"DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, such problems happen from time to time, but we are always happy to help you and solve any issues;","Q13_TEXT_3":"Cryptocurrency updates. We may update the client and disable some coins. As soon as we turn them back on, you will get your funds right away;","Q13_TEXT_4":"The blockchain is overloaded. Too many transactions are waiting to be included into the blockchain, and yours may wait for its turn, too. Sometimes you might have to wait a little longer.","Q14_TITLE":"What is the minimal amount for exchange?","Q14_TEXT":"There are no limits for cryptocurrency exchanges on ChangeNOW. However, for a transaction to be carried out, a network fee is charged by the blockchain itself. The amount sent must be sufficient to cover all the network fees.","Q15_TITLE":"What is a fixed rate cryptocurrency exchange?","Q15_TEXT_1":"A fixed rate crypto exchange is an exchange performed at the same rate which is displayed to the client at the beginning of an exchange, regardless of subsequent rate fluctuations.","Q16_TITLE":"What's the difference between fixed rate flow and standard flow?","Q16_TEXT_1":"During the standard flow, each transaction may have its own unique exchange rate because of rate fluctuations, market conditions, and network fees. The rate might change at any moment; as a result, you might receive more or less than you thought you would.","Q16_TEXT_2":"Implementing fixed rate exchanges leads us to lay down a small reserve to guarantee your safety from exchange rate fluctuations. It's included into the rate you will see at the beginning of the exchange, no other fees included.","Q16_TEXT_3":"Because of the rate risks we take, the fixed rate may differ from the standard flow's rate. However, it gives our customers confidence in the amount they will receive.","Q17_TITLE":"When should I choose the fixed rate flow?","Q17_TEXT":"You may choose the fixed rate flow if you would like to be certain that the amount of crypto you'll receive will stay the same, no matter what. With fixed rate exchanges, our users enjoy the stability of their conversions and are safe from sudden rate drops.","Q18_TITLE":"ChangeNOW performs certain cryptocurrency exchanges through third-party partner services. What does that mean?","Q18_TEXT_1":"It means exactly that - exchanges of certain trading pairs are carried through our partners. These exchanges aren't much different from regular ChangeNOW swaps, however, there are a few things you might want to keep in mind:","Q18_TEXT_2":"In these cases we don't carry out any KYC checks on our side. However, they might be carried out by our partners;","Q18_TEXT_3":"Please be aware that other services that we are partnered with might have KYC policies that are different from ours;","Q18_TEXT_4":"However, us carrying out exchanges through third party services does not mean we forfeit our responsibility for the exchange. If you run into any issues during the swap, just let our support team know and we'll help you out in the shortest time possible.","Q19_TITLE":"Do I need to register to use ChangeNOW?","Q19_TEXT_1":"In order to be able to use ChangeNOW, customers don't need to create any sort of accounts.","Q19_TEXT_2":"However, there are some exceptions.","Q19_TEXT_3":"ChangeNOW uses an automated risk management system to check all transactions.

Thus, you confirm that you are a law-abiding citizen and the state has no reason to address any claims towards you.","Q21_TITLE":"KYC/AML procedure","Q21_TEXT_1":"ChangeNOW’s AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by this system, the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then asked to confirm their identity.","Q21_TEXT_2":"There is a certain set of criteria that the system employs; however, they can’t be made public, otherwise there will be people who will try to abuse those criteria in order to cheat the algorithm.","Q21_TEXT_3":"This system has proven to be very useful against money launderers and scammers, since the KYC process allows us to tell an honest customer apart from a scammer very quickly and without any trouble.","Q21_TEXT_4":"Each KYC case is handled individually. If a certain client is eligible for the procedure since their transaction had been marked as suspicious, they are informed of that with a pop-up notification after the exchange has been submitted, in which they will be asked to turn to the support team. We will apply a set of standard procedures to our KYC clients, among which are asking a client to submit the following:","Q21_TEXT_5":"A high-quality photo of any identification document valid in their country or internationally;","Q21_TEXT_6":"A source of deposited funds (a screenshot or a file, but not links);","Q21_TEXT_7":"A selfie of the client holding their ID document and a print-out of the note which will be provided by the support team.","Q21_TEXT_8":"After ChangeNOW has received the following materials, the exchange is completed, and the exchanged funds are then sent to the specified recipient wallet address.","Q21_TEXT_9":"We do everything in our power to maintain our reputation as a legitimate, law-abiding exchange service that can be safe for use by anyone, be it a regular person who doesn’t deal with crypto much or an experienced trader or miner; therefore, ChangeNOW reserves the right to apply the KYC/AML procedure to certain clients, wallet addresses and select assets.","Q21_TEXT_10":"ChangeNOW doesn’t support any money-laundering or other illegal activities; therefore, the service doesn’t enter any business agreements with individuals or business entities involved or suspected in such activities.","Q21_TEXT_11":"In case a client doesn’t wish to disclose their identity for certain reasons and refuses to provide the documents, the KYC/AML procedure is considered failed and the deposited funds are then refunded to the address (or addresses) the deposit was made from, subtracting the network fees, within 24 hours. Then, ChangeNOW reserves the right to blacklist this address (or addresses), thus rendering it (or them) non-eligible for making deposits on the service.","Q21_TEXT_12":"In case a client submits a false set of documents, the KYC/AML procedure is considered failed and the deposited funds are then refunded to the address (or addresses) the deposit was made from, subtracting the network fees, within 24 hours. Then, ChangeNOW reserves the right to blacklist this address (or addresses), thus rendering it (or them) non-eligible for making deposits on the service.","Q21_TEXT_13":"Please bear in mind that ChangeNOW reserves the right to submit all the received materials to legal authorities (Interpol, Europol, and others) in case a corresponding request is received.
